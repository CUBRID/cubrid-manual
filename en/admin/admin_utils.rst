cubrid Utility Logging
----------------------
 
CUBRID supports logging feature for the execution result of **cubrid** utilities; for details, see :ref:`cubrid-utility-logging`.

.. _creating-database:

.. _createdb:

createdb
--------

The **cubrid createdb** utility creates databases and initializes them with the built-in CUBRID system tables. It can also define initial users to be authorized in the database and specify the locations of the logs and databases. In general, the **cubrid createdb** utility is used only by DBA. 

.. warning::

    When you create database, a locale name and a charset name after a DB name must be specified(e.g. ko_KR.utf8). It affects the length of string type, string comparison operation, etc. The specified charset when creating database cannot be changed later, so you should be careful when specifying it.
    
    For charset, locale and collation setting, see :doc:`/sql/i18n`.

::

    cubrid createdb [options] database_name locale_name.charset

*   **cubrid**: An integrated utility for the CUBRID service and database management.

*   **createdb**: A command used to create a new database.

*   *database_name*: Specifies a unique name for the database to be created, without including the path name to the directory where the database will be created. If the specified database name is the same as that of an existing database name, CUBRID halts creation of the database to protect existing files.

*   *locale_name*: A locale name to use in the database should be input. For a locale name which can be used in CUBRID, refer to :ref:`locale-selection`.

*   *charset*: A characterset to use in the database should be input. A character set which can be used in CUBRID is iso88591, euckr or utf8.
    
    *   If *locale_name* is en_US and *charset* is omitted, a character set will be iso88591.
    *   If *locale_name* is ko_KR and *charset* is omitted, a character set will be utf8.
    *   All locale names except en_US and ko_KR cannot omit *charset*, and a *charset* can be specified only with utf8.

The maximum length of database name is 17 in English.

The following shows [options] available with the **cubrid** **createdb** utility.

.. program:: createdb

::

      --db-volume-size=SIZE           size of first information volume
      --db-page-size=SIZE             database page SIZE in bytes
      --log-volume-size=SIZE          size of log archives

  -o, --output-file=FILE              redirect output messages to FILE
  -v, --verbose                       enable verbose status messages


.. option:: --db-volume-size=SIZE

    This option specifies the size of the database volume that will be created first. The default value is the value of the system parameter **db_volume_size**. You can set units as K, M, G and T, which stand for kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), and terabytes (TB) respectively; if you omit the unit, bytes will be applied. The size of the database is always rounded up to 64 disk sectors, which depends on the size of a page and can be 16M, 32M or 64M for page size 4k, 8k and 16k respectively.

    The following example shows how to create a database named *testdb* and assign 512 MB to its first volume. ::

        cubrid createdb --db-volume-size=512M testdb en_US

.. option:: --db-page-size=SIZE

    This option specifies the size of the database page; the minimum value is 4K and the maximum value is **16K** (default). K stands for kilobytes (KB). The value of page size is one of the following: 4K, 8K, or 16K. If a value between 4K and 16K is specified, system rounds up the number. If a value greater than 16K or less than 4K, the specified number is used.

    The following example shows how to create a database named *testdb* and configure its page size 16K. ::

        cubrid createdb --db-page-size=16K testdb en_US

.. option:: --log-volume-size=SIZE

    This option  specifies the size of the database log volume. The default value is the same as database volume size, and the minimum value is 20M. You can set units as K, M, G and T, which stand for kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), and terabytes (TB) respectively. If you omit the unit, bytes will be applied.

    The following example shows how to create a database named *testdb* and assign 256 MB to its log volume. ::

        cubrid createdb --log-volume-size=256M testdb en_US

.. option:: --log-page-size=SIZE

    This option specifies the size of the log volume page. The default value is the same as data page size. The minimum value is 4K and the maximum value is 16K. K stands for kilobytes (KB).
    The value of page size is one of the following: 4K, 8K, or 16K. If a value between 4K and 16K is specified, system rounds up the number. If a value greater than 16K or less than 4K, the specified number is used.

    The following example shows how to create  a database named *testdb* and configure its log volume page size 8K. ::

        cubrid createdb --log-page-size=8K testdb en_US

.. option:: --comment=COMMENT

    This option specifies a comment to be included in the database volume header. If the character string contains spaces, the comment must be enclosed in double quotes.

    The following example shows how to create a database named *testdb* and add a comment to the database volume. ::

        cubrid createdb --comment "a new database for study" testdb en_US

.. option:: -F, --file-path=PATH

    The **-F** option specifies an absolute path to a directory where the new database will be created. If the **-F** option is not specified, the new database is created in the current working directory.

    The following example shows how to create a database named *testdb* in the directory /dbtemp/new_db. ::

        cubrid createdb -F "/dbtemp/new_db/" testdb en_US

.. option:: -L, --log-path=PATH

    The **-L** option specifies an absolute path to the directory where database log files are created. If the **-L** option is not specified, log files are created in the directory specified by the **-F** option. 
    If neither **-F** nor **-L** option is specified, database log files are created in the current working directory.

    The following example shows how to create a database named *testdb* in the directory /dbtemp/newdb and log files in the directory /dbtemp/db_log. ::

        cubrid createdb -F "/dbtemp/new_db/" -L "/dbtemp/db_log/" testdb en_US

.. option:: -B, --lob-base-path=PATH

    This option specifies a directory where **LOB** data files are stored when **BLOB/CLOB** data is used. If the **\-\-lob-base-path** option is not specified, LOB data files are store in <*location of database volumes created*>/**lob** directory. 

    The following example shows how to create a database named *testdb* in the working directory and specify /home/data1 of local file system as a location of LOB data files. ::

        cubrid createdb --lob-base-path "file:/home1/data1" testdb en_US

.. option:: --server-name=HOST

    This option enables the server of a specific database to run in the specified host when CUBRID client/server is used. The information of a host specified is stored in the **databases.txt** file. If this option is not specified, the current localhost is specified by default. 
    
    The following example shows how to create a database named *testdb* and register it on the host *aa_host*. ::

        cubrid createdb --server-name aa_host testdb en_US

.. option:: -r, --replace

    This option creates a new database and overwrites an existing database if one with the same name exists. 
    
    The following example shows how to create a new database named *testdb* and overwrite the existing database with the same name. ::

        cubrid createdb -r testdb en_US

.. option:: --more-volume-file=FILE

    This option creates an additional volume based on the specification contained in the file specified by the option. The volume is created in the same directory where the database is created. Instead of using this option, you can add a volume by using the **cubrid addvoldb** utility. 

    The following example shows how to create a database named *testdb* as well as an additional volume based on the specification stored in the **vol_info.txt** file. ::

        cubrid createdb --more-volume-file vol_info.txt testdb en_US

    The following is a specification of the additional volume contained in the **vol_info.txt** file. The specification of each volume must be written on a single line. ::

        #xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        # NAME volname COMMENTS volcmnts PURPOSE volpurp NPAGES volnpgs
        NAME data_v1 COMMENTS "data information volume" PURPOSE data NPAGES 1000
        NAME data_v2 COMMENTS "data information volume" NPAGES 1000
        NAME temp_v1 COMMENTS "temporary information volume" PURPOSE temp NPAGES 500
        #xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    As shown in the example, the specification of each volume consists following. ::

        [NAME volname] [COMMENTS volcmnts] [PURPOSE volpurp] NPAGES volnpgs

    *   *volname*: The name of the volume to be created. It must follow the UNIX file name conventions and be a simple name not including the directory path. The specification of a volume name can be omitted. If it is, the "database name to be created by the system_volume identifier" becomes the volume name.

    *   *volcmnts*: Comment to be written in the volume header. It contains information on the additional volume to be created. The specification of the comment on a volume can also be omitted.

    *   *volpurp*: The purpose for which the volume will be used. It can be either permanent data (default option) or temporary. 

	.. note:: 
		For backward compatibility, all old keywords, **data**, **index**, **temp**, or **generic** are accepted. **temp** stands for temporary data purpose, while the rest stand for permanent data purpose.


    *   *volnpgs*: The number of pages of the additional volume to be created. The specification of the number of pages of the volume cannot be omitted; it must be specified. The actual volume size is rounded up to the next multiple of **64 sectors**.

.. option:: --user-definition-file=FILE

    This option adds users who have access to the database to be created. It adds a user based on the specification contained in the user information file specified by the parameter. 
    Instead of using the **\-\-user-definition-file** option, you can add a user by using the **CREATE USER** statement (for details, see :ref:`create-user`).

    The following example shows how to create a database named *testdb* and add users to *testdb* based on the user information defined in the **user_info.txt** file. ::

        cubrid createdb --user-definition-file=user_info.txt testdb en_US

    The syntax of a user information file is as follows: ::

        USER user_name [ <groups_clause> | <members_clause> ]
        
        <groups_clause>: 
            [ GROUPS <group_name> [ { <group_name> }... ] ]

        <members_clause>: 
            [ MEMBERS <member_name> [ { <member_name> }... ] ]

    *   The *user_name* is the name of the user who has access to the database. It must not include spaces.

    *   The **GROUPS** clause is optional. The *group_name* is the upper level group that contains the *user_name* . Here, the *group_name* can be multiply specified and must be defined as **USER** in advance.

    *   The **MEMBERS** clause is optional. The *member_name* is the name of the lower level member that belongs to the *user_name* . Here, the *member_name* can be multiply specified and must be defined as **USER** in advance.

    Comments can be used in a user information file. A comment line must begin with a consecutive hyphen lines (\-\-). Blank lines are ignored.

    The following example shows a user information in which *grandeur* and *sonata* are included in *sedan* group, *tuscan* is included in *suv* group, and *i30* is included in *hatchback* group. The name of the user information file is **user_info.txt**. ::

        --
        -- Example 1 of a user information file
        --
        USER sedan
        USER suv
        USER hatchback
        USER grandeur GROUPS sedan
        USER sonata GROUPS sedan
        USER tuscan GROUPS suv
        USER i30 GROUPS hatchback

    The following example shows a file that has the same user relationship information as the file above. The difference is that the **MEMBERS** statement is used in the file below. ::

        --
        -- Example 2 of a user information file
        --
        USER grandeur
        USER sonata
        USER tuscan
        USER i30
        USER sedan MEMBERS sonata grandeur
        USER suv MEMBERS tuscan
        USER hatchback MEMBERS i30
    
.. option:: --csql-initialization-file=FILE

    This option executes an SQL statement on the database to be created by using the CSQL Interpreter. A schema can be created based on the SQL statement contained in the file specified by the parameter.

    The following example shows how to create a database named *testdb* and execute the SQL statement defined in table_schema.sql through the CSQL Interpreter. ::

        cubrid createdb --csql-initialization-file table_schema.sql testdb en_US

.. option:: -o, --output-file=FILE

    This option stores messages related to the database creation to the file given as a parameter. The file is created in the same directory where the database was created. 
    If the **-o** option is not specified, messages are displayed on the console screen. The **-o** option allows you to use information on the creation of a certain database by storing messages, generated during the database creation, to a specified file.

    The following example shows how to create a database named *testdb* and store the output of the utility to the **db_output** file instead of displaying it on the console screen. ::

        cubrid createdb -o db_output testdb en_US

.. option:: -v, --verbose

    This option displays all information on the database creation operation onto the screen. Like the **-o** option, this option is useful in checking information related to the creation of a specific database. Therefore, if you specify the **-v** option together with the **-o** option, you can store the output messages in the file given as a parameter; the messages contain the operation information about the **cubrid createdb** utility and database creation process.

    The following example shows how to create a database named *testdb* and display detailed information on the operation onto the screen. ::

        cubrid createdb -v testdb en_US

.. note::

    *   **temp_file_max_size_in_pages** is a parameter used to configure the maximum size of temporary volumes - used for complicated queries or storing arrays - on the disk. With the default value **-1**, the temporary volumes size is only limited by the capacity of the disk specified by the **temp_volume_path** parameter. If the value is 0, no temporary volumes can be created. In this case, a permanent volume with temporary data purpose should be added by using the :ref:`cubrid addvoldb <adding-database-volume>` utility. For an efficient storage management, it is recommended to use the latter approach.
        
    *   By using the :ref:`cubrid spacedb <spacedb>` utility, you can check the remaining space of each volume. By using the :ref:`cubrid addvoldb <adding-database-volume>` utility, you can add more volumes as needed while managing the database. You are advised to add more volumes when there is less system load. When all preassigned volumes are completely in use, the database system automatically creates new volumes.

The following example shows how to create a database, with additional volumes, including one for temporary data purpose. ::

    cubrid createdb --db-volume-size=512M --log-volume-size=256M cubriddb en_US
    cubrid addvoldb -S -n cubriddb_DATA01 --db-volume-size=512M cubriddb
    cubrid addvoldb -S -p temp -n cubriddb_TEMP01 --db-volume-size=512M cubriddb

.. note:: **Creating a database using an existing key file**

    When the database is created, a key file is created together by default. If you want to use an existing key file when creating a database:
   
    #.  Copy the key file with the name **<database-name>_keys**.
    #.  Specify the directory path of the copied key file by the system parameter **tde_keys_file_path**.
    #.  Create a database by using the **createdb utility**.

    For more information on the TDE key file, see :ref:`tde-file-based-key`.

.. _adding-database-volume:

.. _addvoldb:

addvoldb
--------

If you want to micromanage CUBRID storage volumes, addvoldb is the tool for you. You can finely tune each file name, path, purpose, and size. The database system can handle all storage by itself, but it uses default values to configure each new volume.

The command for manually adding a database volume is as follows.

::

    cubrid addvoldb [options] database_name

*   **cubrid**: An integrated utility for CUBRID service and database management.
    
*   **addvoldb**: A command that adds a specified number of pages of the new volume to a specified database.
    
*   *database_name*: Specifies the name of the database to which a volume is to be added without including the path name to the directory where the database is to be created.

The following example shows how to create a database, with additional multi-purpose volumes. ::

    cubrid createdb --db-volume-size=512M --log-volume-size=256M cubriddb en_US
    cubrid addvoldb -S -n cubriddb_DATA01 --db-volume-size=512M cubriddb
    cubrid addvoldb -S -p temp -n cubriddb_TEMP01 --db-volume-size=512M cubriddb

The following shows [options] available with the **cubrid addvoldb** utility.

.. program:: addvoldb

::

      --db-volume-size=SIZE        size of additional volume
  -n, --volume-name=NAME           NAME of information volume
  -F, --file-path=PATH             PATH for adding volume file
      --comment=COMMENT            COMMENT for adding volume file
  -p, --purpose=PURPOSE            PURPOSE for adding volume file
  -S, --SA-mode                    stand-alone mode execution
  -C, --CS-mode                    client-server mode execution
      --max-writesize-in-sec=SIZE  the amount of volume written per second


.. option:: --db-volume-size=SIZE

    **\-\-db-volume-size** is an option that specifies the size of the volume to be added to a specified database. If the **\-\-db-volume-size** option is omitted, the value of the system parameter **db_volume_size** is used by default. You can set units as K, M, G and T, which stand for kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), and terabytes (TB) respectively. If you omit the unit, bytes will be applied. The size of the database is always rounded up to 64 disk sectors, which depends on the size of a page and can be 16M, 32M or 64M for page size 4k, 8k and 16k respectively.

    The following example shows how to add a volume for which 256 MB are assigned to the *testdb* database. ::

        cubrid addvoldb --db-volume-size=256M testdb

.. option:: -n, --volume-name=NAME

    This option specifies the name of the volume to be added to a specified database. The volume name must follow the file name protocol of the operating system and be a simple one without including the directory path or spaces. 
    If the **-n** option is omitted, the name of the volume to be added is configured by the system automatically as "database name_volume identifier". For example, if the database name is *testdb*, the volume name *testdb_x001* is automatically configured.
    
    The following example shows how to specify a different name, *testdb_v1*, to newly added volume. ::

        cubrid addvoldb -n testdb_v1 testdb

.. option:: -F, --file-path=PATH

    This option specifies the directory path where the volume to be added will be stored. If the **-F** option is omitted, the value of the system parameter **volume_extension_path** is used by default.

    The following example shows how to add a volume in the */dbtemp/addvol* directory. Since the **-n** option is not specified for the volume name, the volume name *testdb_x001* will be created. ::

        cubrid addvoldb -F /dbtemp/addvol/ testdb

.. option:: --comment COMMENT

    This option facilitates to retrieve information on the added volume by adding such information in the form of comments. It is recommended that the contents of a comment include the name of **DBA** who adds the volume, or the purpose of adding the volume. The comment must be enclosed in double quotes.  
    
    The following example shows how to add a volume and inserts a comment with additional information. ::

        cubrid addvoldb --comment "Data volume added by cheolsoo kim because permanent data space was almost depleted." testdb

.. option:: -p, --purpose=PURPOSE

    This option specifies the purpose of the volume to be added. The purpose defines the type of files that will be stored in added volume:
    
    * **PERMANENT DATA** to store table rows, indexes and system files.
    * **TEMPORARY DATA** to store intermediate and final results of query processing and sorting.
    
    If not specified, the purpose of the volume is by default considered **PERMANENT DATA**. The following example shows how to change it to temporary. ::
    
        cubrid addvoldb -p temp testdb

    .. note::

	    PERMANENT DATA volumes used to be classified as generic, data and index. The design of volumes has been changed, and since then the classification no longer exists. In order to avoid invalidating your old scripts, we chose to keep the keywords as valid options, but their effect will be the same. The only remaining option value with a real effect is temp.
        
	    For detailed information on each purpose, see :ref:`database-volume-structure`.
    
.. option:: -S, --SA-mode

    This option accesses the database in standalone mode without running the server process. This option has no parameter. If the **-S** option is not specified, the system assumes to be in client/server mode. ::

        cubrid addvoldb -S --db-volume-size=256M testdb

.. option:: -C, --CS-mode

    This option accesses the database in client/server mode by running the server and the client separately. There is no parameter. Even when the **-C** option is not specified, the system assumes to be in client/server mode by default. ::

        cubrid addvoldb -C --db-volume-size=256M testdb

.. option:: --max-writesize-in-sec=SIZE

    The **\-\-max-writesize-in-sec** is used to limit the impact of  system operating when you add a volume to the database. This can limit the maximum writing size per second. The unit of this option is K(kilobytes) and M(megabytes). The minimum value is 160K. If you set this value as less than 160K, it is changed as 160K. It can be used only in client/server mode.
    
    The below is an example to limit the writing size of the 2GB volume as 1MB. Consuming time will be about 35 minutes(= (2048MB/1MB) /60 sec.). ::

.. _deleting-database:

.. _deletedb:

deletedb
--------

The **cubrid deletedb** utility is used to delete a database. You must use the **cubrid deletedb** utility to delete a database, instead of using the file deletion commands of the operating system; a database consists of a few interdependent files. 

The **cubrid deletedb** utility also deletes the information on the database from the database location file (**databases.txt**). The **cubrid deletedb** utility must be run offline, that is, in standalone mode when nobody is using the database. ::

    cubrid deletedb  [options] database_name

*   **cubrid**: An integrated utility for the CUBRID service and database management.

*   **deletedb**: A command to delete a database, its related data, logs and all backup files. It can be executed successfully only when the database is in a stopped state.

*   *database_name*: Specifies the name of the database to be deleted without including the path name.

The following shows [options] available with the **cubrid deletedb** utility.

.. program:: deletedb

::

  -o, --output-file=FILE       redirect output messages to FILE
  -d, --delete-backup          delete backup volumes


.. option:: -o, --output-file=FILE

    This option specifies the file name for writing messages::

        cubrid deletedb -o deleted_db.out testdb

    The **cubrid** **deletedb** utility also deletes the database information contained in the database location file (**databases.txt**). The following message is returned if you enter a utility that tries to delete a non-existing database. ::

        cubrid deletedb testdb
        Database "testdb" is unknown, or the file "databases.txt" cannot be accessed.

.. option:: -d, --delete-backup

    This option deletes database volumes, backup volumes and backup information files simultaneously. If the -**d** option is not specified, backup volume and backup information files are not deleted. ::
    
        cubrid deletedb -d testdb

.. _renamedb:

renamedb
--------

The **cubrid renamedb** utility renames a database. The names of information volumes, log volumes and control files are also renamed to conform to the new database one.

In contrast, the **cubrid alterdbhost** utility configures or changes the host name of the specified database. In other words, it changes the host name configuration in the **databases.txt** file. ::

    cubrid renamedb [options] src_database_name dest_database_name

*   **cubrid**: An integrated utility for the CUBRID service and database management.

*   **renamedb**: A command that changes the existing name of a database to a new one. It executes successfully only when the database is in a stopped state. The names of related information volumes, log volumes and control files are also changed to new ones accordingly.

*   *src_database_name*: The name of the existing database to be renamed. The path name to the directory where the database is to be created must not be included.

*   *dest_database_name*: The new name of the database. It must not be the same as that of an existing database. The path name to the directory where the database is to be created must not be included.

The following shows [options] available with the **cubrid renamedb** utility.

.. program:: renamedb

::

  -E, --extended-volume-path=PATH directory PATH for extended information volumes
  -i, --control-file=FILE         renaming volumes over several locations written in the control file
  -d, --delete-backup             delete backup volumes


.. option:: -E, --extended-volume-path=PATH

    This option renames an extended volume created in a specific directory path (e.g. /dbtemp/addvol/), and then moves the volume to a new directory. This specifies a new directory path (e.g. /dbtemp/newaddvols/) where the renamed extended volume will be moved. 

    If it is not specified, the extended volume is only renamed in the existing path without being moved. If a directory path outside the disk partition of the existing database volume or an invalid one is specified, the rename operation is not executed. This option cannot be used together with the **-i** option. ::

        cubrid renamedb -E /dbtemp/newaddvols/ testdb testdb_1

.. option:: -i, --control-file=FILE

    The option specifies an input file in which directory information is stored to change all database name of volumes or files and assign different directory at once. To perform this work, the **-i** option is used. 
    The **-i** option cannot be used together with the **-E** option. ::

        cubrid renamedb -i rename_path testdb testdb_1

    The following are the syntax and example of a file that contains the name of each volume, the current directory path and the directory path where renamed volumes will be stored. ::

        volid source_fullvolname dest_fullvolname

    *   *volid*: An integer that is used to identify each volume. It can be checked in the database volume control file (database_name_vinf).

    *   *source_fullvolname*: The current directory path to each volume.

    *   *dest_fullvolname*: The target directory path where renamed volumes will be moved. If the target directory path is invalid, the database rename operation is not executed.

    ::

        -5  /home1/user/testdb_vinf       /home1/CUBRID/databases/testdb_1_vinf
        -4  /home1/user/testdb_lginf      /home1/CUBRID/databases/testdb_1_lginf
        -3  /home1/user/testdb_bkvinf     /home1/CUBRID/databases/testdb_1_bkvinf
        -2  /home1/user/testdb_lgat       /home1/CUBRID/databases/testdb_1_lgat
         0  /home1/user/testdb            /home1/CUBRID/databases/testdb_1
         1  /home1/user/backup/testdb_x001/home1/CUBRID/databases/backup/testdb_1_x001

.. option:: -d, --delete-backup

    This option renames the *testdb* database and at once forcefully delete all backup volumes and backup information files that are in the same location as *testdb*. Note that you cannot use the backup files with the old names once the database is renamed. If the **-d** option is not specified, backup volumes and backup information files are not deleted. ::

        cubrid renamedb -d testdb testdb_1

.. _alterdbhost:

alterdbhost
-----------

The **cubrid alterdbhost** utility sets or changes the host name of the specified database. It changes the host name set in the **databases.txt** file. ::

    cubrid alterdbhost [option] database_name

*   **cubrid**: An integrated utility for the CUBRID service and database management

*   **alterdbhost**: A command used to change the host name of the current database

The following shows the option available with the **cubrid alterdbhost** utility.

.. program:: alterdbhost

.. option:: -h, --host=HOST

    The *-h* option specifies the host name to be changed. When this option is omitted, specifies the host name to localhost.

.. _copydb:

copydb
------

The **cubrid copydb** utility copy or move a database to another location. As arguments, source and target name of database must be given. A target database name must be different from a source database name. When the target name argument is specified, the location of target database name is registered in the **databases.txt** file. 

The **cubrid copydb** utility can be executed only offline (that is, state of a source database stop). ::

    cubrid copydb [options] src-database-name dest-database-name

*   **cubrid**: An integrated utility for the CUBRID service and database management.

*   **copydb**: A command that copy or move a database from one to another location.

*   *src-database-name*: The names of source and target databases to be copied or moved.

*   *dest-database-name*: A new (target) database name.

If options are omitted, a target database is copied into the same directory of a source database.

The following shows [options] available with the **cubrid copydb** utility.

.. program:: copydb

::

      --server-name=HOST          server's HOST name
  -F, --file-path=PATH            directory PATH for database volumes
  -L, --log-path=PATH             directory PATH for log volumes
  -E, --extended-volume-path=PATH directory PATH for extended information volumes
  -i, --control-file=FILE         copying volumes over several locations written in the control file
  -r, --replace                   replace an existing database
  -d, --delete-source             delete a source database
      --copy-lob-path=PATH        copy external storage PATH for LOB data from source database
  -B, --lob-base-path=PATH        base directory PATH for external LOB data


.. option:: --server-name=HOST

    The **\-\-server-name** option specifies a host name of new database. The host name is registered in the **databases.txt** file. If this option is omitted, a local host is registered. ::
    
        cubrid copydb --server-name=cub_server1 demodb new_demodb

.. option:: -F, --file-path=PATH

    The *-F* option specifies a specific directory path where a new database volume is stored with an **-F** option. It represents specifying an absolute path. If the specified directory does not exist, an error is displayed. If this option is omitted, a new database volume is created in the current working directory. And this information is specified in **vol-path** of the **databases.txt** file. ::

        cubrid copydb -F /home/usr/CUBRID/databases demodb new_demodb

.. option:: -L, --log-path=PATH

    The *-L* option specifies a specific directory path where a new database volume is stored with an **-L** option. It represents specifying an absolute path. If the specified directory does not exist, an error is displayed. If this option is omitted, a new database volume is created in the current working directory. And this information is specified in **log-path** of the **databases.txt** file. ::

        cubrid copydb -L /home/usr/CUBRID/databases/logs demodb new_demodb

.. option:: -E, --extended-volume-path=PATH

    The *-E* option specifies a specific directory path where a new database extended volume is stored with an **-E**. If this option is omitted, a new database extended volume is created in the location of a new database volume or in the registered path of controlling file. The **-i** option cannot be used with this option. ::

        cubrid copydb -E home/usr/CUBRID/databases/extvols demodb new_demodb

.. option:: -i, --control-file=FILE

    The **-i** option specifies an input file where a new directory path information and a source volume are stored to copy or move multiple volumes into a different directory, respectively. This option cannot be used with the **-E** option. An input file named copy_path is specified in the example below. ::

        cubrid copydb -i copy_path demodb new_demodb

    The following is an example of input file that contains each volume name, current directory path, and new directory and volume names. ::

        # volid   source_fullvolname   dest_fullvolname
        0 /usr/databases/demodb        /drive1/usr/databases/new_demodb
        1 /usr/databases/demodb_data1  /drive1/usr/databases/new_demodb_data1
        2 /usr/databases/ext/demodb_ext1 /drive2//usr/databases/new_demodb_ext1
        3 /usr/databases/ext/demodb_ext2  /drive2/usr/databases/new_demodb_ext2

    *   *volid*: An integer that is used to identify each volume. It can be checked in the database volume control file (**database_name_vinf**).

    *   *source_fullvolname*: The current directory path to each source database volume.

    *   *dest_fullvolname*: The target directory path where new volumes will be stored. You should specify a valid path.  

.. option:: -r, --replace

    If the **-r** option is specified, a new database name overwrites the existing database name if it is identical, instead of outputting an error. ::

        cubrid copydb -r -F /home/usr/CUBRID/databases demodb new_demodb

.. option:: -d, --delete-source

    If the **-d** option is specified, a source database is deleted after the database is copied. This execution brings the same the result as executing **cubrid deletedb** utility after copying a database. Note that if a source database contains LOB data, LOB file directory path of a source database is copied into a new database and it is registered in the **lob-base-path** of the **databases.txt** file. ::

        cubrid copydb -d -F /home/usr/CUBRID/databases demodb new_demodb

.. option:: --copy-lob-path=PATH

    If the **\-\-copy-lob-path** option is specified, a new directory path for LOB files is created and a source database is copied into a new directory path. If this option is omitted, the directory path is not created. Therefore, the **lob-base-path** of the **databases.txt** file should be modified separately. This option cannot be used with the **-B** option. ::

        cubrid copydb --copy-lob-path demodb new_demodb

.. option:: -B, --lob-base-path=PATH

    If the **-B** option is specified, a specified directory is specified as for LOB files of a new database and a source database is copied. This option cannot be used with the **\-\-copy-lob-path** option. ::

        cubrid copydb -B /home/usr/CUBRID/databases/new_lob demodb new_demodb

.. _installdb:

installdb
---------

The **cubrid installdb** utility is used to register the information of a newly installed database to **databases.txt**, which stores database location information. The execution of this utility does not affect the operation of the database to be registered.

*   **cubrid**: An integrated utility for the CUBRID service and database management.

*   **installdb**: A command that registers the information of a moved or copied database to **databases.txt**.

*   *database_name*: The name of database to be registered to **databases.txt**.

If no [options] are used, the command must be executed in the directory where the corresponding database exists.

The following shows [options] available with the **cubrid installdb** utility.

.. program:: installdb

::

      --server-name=HOST       server HOST name
  -F, --file-path=PATH         directory PATH for database volumes
  -L, --log-path=PATH          directory PATH for log volumes


.. option:: --server-name=HOST

    This option registers the server host information of a database to **databases.txt** with a specific host name. If this is not specified, the current host information is registered. ::

        cubrid installdb --server-name=cub_server1 testdb

.. option::-F, --file-path=PATH

    This option registers the absolute directory path of a database volume to **databases.txt** by using the **-F** option. If this option is not specified, the path of a current directory is registered as default. ::

        cubrid installdb -F /home/cubrid/CUBRID/databases/testdb testdb

.. option:: -L, --log-path=PATH

    This option registers the absolute directory path of a database log volume to **databases.txt** by using the **-L** option. If this option is not specified, the directory path of a volume is registered. ::

.. option:: -o FILE

    This option stores the result of checking the space information of *testdb* to a file named *db_output*. ::

        cubrid spacedb -o db_output testdb

.. option:: -S, --SA-mode

    This option is used to access a database in standalone, which means it works without processing server; it does not have an argument. If **-S** is not specified, the system recognizes that a database is running in client/server mode. ::

        cubrid spacedb --SA-mode testdb

.. option:: -C, --CS-mode

    This option is used to access a database in client/server mode, which means it works in client/server process respectively; it does not have an argument. 
    If **-C** is not specified, the system recognize that a database is running in client/server mode by default. ::

        cubrid spacedb --CS-mode testdb

.. option:: --size-unit={PAGE|M|G|T|H}

    This option specifies the size unit of the space information of the database to be one of PAGE, M(MB), G(GB), T(TB), H(print-friendly). The default value is **H**. 
    If you set the value to H, the unit is automatically determined as follows: M if 1 MB = DB size < 1024 MB, G if 1 GB = DB size < 1024 GB. ::

.. _compactdb:

compactdb
---------

The **cubrid compactdb** utility is used to secure unused space of the database volume. In case the database server is not running (offline), you can perform the job in standalone mode. In case the database server is running, you can perform it in client-server mode.

.. note::

    The **cubrid compactdb** utility secures the space being taken by OIDs of deleted objects and by class changes. When an object is deleted, the space taken by its OID is not immediately freed because there might be other objects that refer to the deleted one. 

    Therefore, when you make a table to reuse OIDs, it is recommended to use a REUSE_OID option as below.

    cubrid compactdb [options] database_name [schema_name.class_name [{, schema_name.class_name}]]

*   **cubrid**: An integrated utility for the CUBRID service and database management.

*   **compactdb**: A command that compacts the space of the database so that OIDs assigned to deleted data can be reused.

*   *database_name*: The name of the database whose space is to be compacted. The path name to the directory where the database is to be created must not be included.

*   *class_name_list*: You can specify the list of tables names that you want to compact space after a database name; the **-i** option cannot be used together. The table name must be prefixed with the schema name. If you use the lists on client/server mode, it skips securing space taken by objects such as catalog, delete files and tracker, etc. 

**-I**, **-c**, **-d**, **-p** options are applied in client/server mode only.

The following shows [options] available with the **cubrid compactdb** utility.

.. program:: compactdb

::

  -v, --verbose                     enable verbose status messages
  -S, --SA-mode                     stand-alone mode execution
  -C, --CS-mode                     client-server mode execution
  -i, --input-class-file=FILE       input FILE of table names
  -p, --pages-commited-once=NUMBER  maximum number of pages to commit once
  -d, --delete-old-repr             delete old class representations from catalog
  -I, --Instance-lock-timeout       timeout for instance lock
  -c, --class-lock-timeout          timeout for class lock


.. option:: -v, --verbose

    You can output messages that shows which class is currently being compacted and how many instances have been processed for the class by using the **-v** option. ::

        cubrid compactdb -v testdb

.. option:: -S, --SA-mode

    This option specifies to compact used space in standalone mode while database server is not running; no argument is specified.  
    If the **-S** option is not specified, system recognizes that the job is executed in client/server mode. ::

        cubrid compactdb --SA-mode testdb

.. option:: -C, --CS-mode

    This option specifies to compact used space in client/server mode while database server is running; no argument is specified. Even though this option is omitted, system recognizes that the job is executed in client/server mode. 

.. option:: -i, --input-class-file=FILE

    You can specify an input file name that contains the table name with this option. Write one table name in a single line; invalid table name is ignored. The table name must be prefixed with the schema name. Note that you cannot specify the list of the table names after a database name in case of you use this option. If you use this option on client/server mode, it skips securing space taken by objects such as catalog, delete files and tracker, etc.

The following options can be used in client/server mode only.

.. option:: -p, --pages-commited-once=NUMBER

    You can specify the number of maximum pages that can be committed once with this option. The default value is 10, the minimum value is 1, and the maximum value is 10. The less option value is specified, the more concurrency is enhanced because the value for class/instance lock is small; however, it causes slowdown on operation, and vice versa. ::

        cubrid compactdb --CS-mode -p 10 testdb public.tbl1, public.tbl2, public.tbl5

.. option:: -d, --delete-old-repr

    You can delete an existing table representation (schema structure) from catalog with this option. Generally you'd better keep the existing table representation because schema updating cost will be saved when you keep the status as referring to the past schema for the old records.

.. option:: -I, --Instance-lock-timeout=NUMBER 

    You can specify a value of instance lock timeout with this option. The default value is 2 (seconds), the minimum value is 1, and the maximum value is 10. The less option value is specified, the more operation speeds up. However, the number of instances that can be processed becomes smaller, and vice versa.

.. option:: -c, --class-lock-timeout=NUMBER

    You can specify a value of instance lock timeout with this option. The default value is 10 (seconds), the minimum value is 1, and the maximum value is 10. The less option value is specified, the more operation speeds up. However, the number of tables that can be processed becomes smaller, and vice versa. 

.. _optimizedb:

optimizedb
----------

Updates statistical information such as the number of objects, the number of pages to access, and the distribution of attribute values. ::

    cubrid optimizedb [<option>] database_name

*   **cubrid**: An integrated utility for the CUBRID service and database management.

*   **optimizedb**: Updates the statistics information, which is used for cost-based query optimization of the database. If the option is specified, only the information of the specified class is updated.

*   *database_name*: The name of the database whose cost-based query optimization statistics are to be updated.

The following shows <option> available with the **cubrid optimizedb** utility.

.. program:: optimizedb

.. option:: -n, --class-name

    The following example shows how to update the query statistics information of the given class by using the **-n** option. The table name must be prefixed with the schema name.
    
    ::

        cubrid optimizedb -n public.event_table testdb

The following example shows how to update the query statistics information of all classes in the database. ::

    cubrid optimizedb testdb

.. _plandump:

plandump
--------

The **cubrid plandump** utility is used to display information on the query plans stored (cached) on the server. ::

    cubrid plandump [options] database_name 

*   **cubrid**: An integrated utility for the CUBRID service and database management.

*   **plandump**: A utility that displays the query plans stored in the current cache of a specific database.

*   *database_name*: The name of the database where the query plans are to be checked or dropped from its server cache.

If no option is used, it checks the query plans stored in the cache. ::

    cubrid plandump testdb

The following shows [options] available with the **cubrid plandump** utility.

.. program:: plandump

::

  -d, --drop                   drop all plans in the server's cache
  -o, --output-file=FILE       redirect output messages to FILE


.. option:: -d, --drop
 
    This option drops the query plans stored in the cache. ::

        cubrid plandump -d testdb

.. option:: -o, --output-file=FILE

    This option stores the results of the query plans stored in the cache to a file. ::

        cubrid plandump -o output.txt testdb

.. _statdump:

statdump
--------

**cubrid statdump** utility checks statistics information processed by the CUBRID database server. The statistics information mainly consists of the following: File I/O, Page buffer, Logs, Transactions, Concurrency/Lock, Index, and Network request.

You can also use CSQL's session commands to check the statistics information only about the CSQL's connection. For details, see :ref:`Dumping CSQL execution statistics information <csql-execution-statistics>`.

::

    cubrid statdump [options] database_name

*   **cubrid**: An integrated utility for the CUBRID service and database management.

*   **statdump**: A command that dumps the statistics information on the database server execution.

*   *database_name*: The name of database which has the statistics data to be dumped.

The following shows [options] available with the **cubrid statdump** utility.

.. program:: statdump

::

  -i, --interval=S             print stats every S secs
  -o, --output-file=FILE       redirect output message to FILE
  -c, --cumulative             print cumulative stats
  -s, --substr=STRING          print stat item only that match the substring


.. option:: -i, --interval=SECOND

    This option specifies the periodic number of Dumping statistics as seconds.

    The following outputs the accumulated values per second. ::
    
        cubrid statdump -i 1 -c demodb
        
    The following outputs the accumulated values during 1 second, as starting with 0 value per every 1 second. ::
    
        cubrid statdump -i 1 demodb
        
    The following outputs the last values which were executed with **-i** option. ::
    
        cubrid statdump demodb
        
    The following outputs the same values with the above. **-c** option doesn't work if it is not used with **-i** option together.
    
        cubrid statdump -c demodb

    The following outputs the values per every 5 seconds.

    ::

        $ cubrid statdump -i 5 -c testdb

    The following are the explanation about the above statistical information. You can find the statistic category (database module), the name, the stat type and a brief description for each statistic.
    
    There are several types of statistic, based on how they are collected:
    
    *  Accumulator: The stat values are incremented whenever the tracked action happens.
    *  Counter/timer: The stat tracks both the number and the duration of an action. Also biggest and average duration are tracked.
    *  Snapshot: The stat is peeked from database.
    *  Complex: The stat tracks multiple values for an action, separated by various attributes.

    Most statistics are accumulators (they are incremented when an action happens). Other statistics can be counter/timers (they track both number of actions and their duration), some are peeked from database (snapshot) and some are computed based on other values. Lastly, there are several complex statistics which track detailed information on some operations.

.. Note::  

    (*) : These statistics measure the non-MVCC operations or MVCC operations which are performed in-place (decided internally)


.. option:: -o, --output-file=FILE

    **-o** options is used to store statistics information of server processing for the database to a specified file.  ::

        cubrid statdump -o statdump.log testdb

.. option:: -c, --cumulative

    You can display the accumulated operation statistics information of the target database server by using the **-c** option.

    Num_data_page_fix_ext, Num_data_page_unfix_ext, Time_data_page_hold_acquire_time, Time_data_page_fix_acquire_time information can be output only when this option is specified; however, these informations will be omitted because they are for CUBRID Engine developers.

    By combining this with the **-i** option, you can check the operation statistics information at a specified interval.  ::

        cubrid statdump -i 5 -c testdb

.. option:: -s, --substr=STRING

    You can display statistics about items, the names of which include the specified string by using **-s** option.

    The following example shows how to display statistics about items, the names of which include "data".

    ::

        cubrid statdump -s data testdb

    Each status information consists of 64-bit INTEGER data and the corresponding statistics information can be lost if the accumulated value exceeds the limit (highly unlikely though).

.. note::

    Some sets of performance statistics are activated/deactivated by **extended_statistics_activation** system parameter. Each set is represented by a value power of two. To be activated, it needs to be present in the base-2 representation of the system parameter. This is the lists of sets that can be manipulated:

.. _lockdb:

lockdb
------

The **cubrid lockdb** utility is used to check the information on the lock being used by the current transaction in the database. ::

    cubrid lockdb [options] database_name

*   **cubrid**: An integrated utility for the CUBRID service and database management.

*   **lockdb**: A command used to check the information on the lock being used by the current transaction in the database.

*   *database_name*: The name of the database where lock information of the current transaction is to be checked.

The following example shows how to display lock information of the *testdb* database on a screen without any option. ::

    cubrid lockdb testdb

The following shows [options] available with the **cubrid lockdb** utility.
    
.. program:: lockdb

.. option:: -o, --output-file=FILE

    The **-o** option displays the lock information of the *testdb* database as a output.txt. ::

        cubrid lockdb -o output.txt testdb

Output Contents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The output contents of **cubrid lockdb** are divided into three logical sections.

*   Server lock settings

*   Clients that are accessing the database

*   The contents of an object lock table

**Server lock settings**

The first section of the output of **cubrid lockdb** is the database lock settings.

::

    *** Lock Table Dump ***
     Lock Escalation at = 100000, Run Deadlock interval = 0

The lock escalation level is 100,000 records, and the interval to detect deadlock is set to 0 seconds.

For a description of the related system parameters, **lock_escalation** and **deadlock_detection_interval**, see :ref:`lock-parameters`.

**Clients that are accessing the database**

The second section of the output of **cubrid lockdb** includes information on all clients that are connected to the database. This includes the transaction index, program name, user ID, host name, process ID, isolation level and lock timeout settings of each client.

::

    Transaction (index 1, csql, dba@cubriddb|12854)
    Isolation COMMITTED READ
    Timeout_period : Infinite wait

Here, the transaction index is 1, the program name is csql, the user ID is dba, the host name is cubriddb, the client process identifier is 12854, the isolation level is COMMITTED READ and the lock timeout is unlimited.

A client for which transaction index is 0 is the internal system transaction. It can obtain the lock at a specific time, such as the processing of a checkpoint by a database. In most cases, however, this transaction will not obtain any locks.

Because **cubrid lockdb** utility accesses the database to obtain the lock information, the **cubrid lockdb** is an independent client and will be output as such.

**Object lock table**

The third section of the output of the **cubrid lockdb** includes the contents of the object lock table. It shows which client has the lock for which object in which mode, and which client is waiting for which object in which mode. The first part of the result of the object lock table shows how many objects are locked.

::

    Object lock Table:
        Current number of objects which are locked = 2001

**cubrid lockdb** outputs the OID, object type and table name of each object that obtained lock. In addition, it outputs the number of transactions that hold lock for the object (*Num holders*), the number of transactions (*Num blocked-holders*) that hold lock but are blocked since it could not convert the lock to the upper lock (e.g., conversion from **SCH_S_LOCK** to **SCH_M_LOCK**), and the number of different transactions that are waiting for the lock of the object (*Num waiters*). It also outputs the list of client transactions that hold lock, blocked client transactions and waiting client transactions. For rows, but not class, MVCC information is also shown.

The example below shows an object in which the object type is a class, that will be blocked because the class OID( 0| 62| 5 ) that has **IX_LOCK** for transaction 1 and **SCH_S_LOCK** for transaction 2 cannot be converted into **SCH_M_LOCK**. It also shows that transaction 3 is blocked because transaction 2 is waiting for **SCH_M_LOCK** even when transaction 3 is only waiting for **SCH_S_LOCK**.

::

    OID = 0| 62| 5
    Object type: Class = athlete.
    Num holders = 1, Num blocked-holders= 1, Num waiters = 1
    LOCK HOLDERS :
        Tran_index = 1, Granted_mode = IX_LOCK, Count = 1, Nsubgranules = 1
    BLOCKED LOCK HOLDERS :
        Tran_index = 2, Granted_mode = SCH_S_LOCK, Count = 1, Nsubgranules = 0
        Blocked_mode = SCH_M_LOCK
                        Start_waiting_at = Wed Feb 3 14:44:31 2016
                        Wait_for_secs = -1
    LOCK WAITERS :
        Tran_index = 3, Blocked_mode = SCH_S_LOCK
                        Start_waiting_at = Wed Feb 3 14:45:14 2016
                        Wait_for_secs = -1
                        
The next example shows an instance of class, object OID( 2| 50| 1 ), that was inserted by transaction 1 which holds **X_LOCK** on the object. The class has a unique index and the key of inserted instance is about to be modified by transaction 2, which is blocked until transaction 1 is completed.

::

    OID = 2| 50| 1
    Object type: instance of class ( 0| 62| 5) = athlete.
    MVCC info: insert ID = 6, delete ID = missing.
    Num holders = 1, Num blocked-holders= 1, Num waiters = 1
    LOCK HOLDERS :
        Tran_index =   1, Granted_mode =   X_LOCK, Count =   1
    LOCK WAITERS :
        Tran_index =   2, Blocked_mode = X_LOCK
                          Start_waiting_at = Wed Feb 3 14:45:14 2016
                          Wait_for_secs = -1

*Granted_mode* refers to the mode of the obtained lock, and *Blocked_mode* refers to the mode of the blocked lock. *Starting_waiting_at refers* to the time at which the lock was requested, and *Wait_for_secs* refers to the waiting time of the lock. The value of *Wait_for_secs* is determined by **lock_timeout**, a system parameter.

When the object type is a class (table), *Nsubgranules* is displayed, which is the sum of the record locks and the key locks obtained by a specific transaction in the table.

::

    OID = 0| 62| 5
    Object type: Class = athlete.
    Num holders = 2, Num blocked-holders= 0, Num waiters= 0
    LOCK HOLDERS:
    Tran_index = 3, Granted_mode = IX_LOCK, Count = 2, Nsubgranules = 0
    Tran_index = 1, Granted_mode = IX_LOCK, Count = 3, Nsubgranules = 1
    Tran_index = 2, Granted_mode = IX_LOCK, Count = 2, Nsubgranules = 1
    
.. _tranlist:

tranlist
--------

The **cubrid tranlist** is used to check the transaction information of the target database. ::

    cubrid tranlist [options] database_name

If you omit the [options], it displays the total information about each transaction.

"cubrid tranlist demodb" outputs the similar result with "cubrid killtran -q demodb", but tranlist outputs more items; "User name" and "Host name".
"cubrid tranlist -s demodb" outputs the same result with "cubrid killtran -d demodb".

The following shows what information is displayed when you run "cubrid tranlist demodb".

::

    $ cubrid tranlist demodb

    Tran index          User name      Host name      Process id    Program name              Query time    Tran time       Wait for lock holder      SQL_ID       SQL Text

    SQL_ID: e5899a1b76253
    Tran index : 4
    update ta set a = 5 where a > 0

In the above example, when each three transaction is running INSERT statement, UPDATE statement is tried to run in the other transaction. In the above, UPDATE statement with "Tran index" 4 waits for the transactions 3,2,1, which are found in "Wait for lock holder", to be ended.

"SQL Text" is SQLs which are stored into the query plan cache; this is printed out as **empty** when this query's execution is terminated.

Each column's meaning is as following.

    *   Tran index : the index of transaction
    *   User name: database user's name
    *   Host name: host name of CAS which running this transaction
    *   Process id :  client's process id
    *   Program name : program name of a client
    *   Query time : total execution time for the running query (unit: second)
    *   Tran time : total run time for the current transaction (unit: second)
    *   Wait for lock holder : the list of transactions which own the lock when the current transaction is waiting for a lock
    *   SQL_ID: an ID for SQL Text
    *   SQL Text : running  SQL text (maximum 30 characters)

Transaction status messages, which are shown on "Tran index", are as follows.
    
    *   ACTIVE : active state
    *   RECOVERY : recovering transaction
    *   COMMITTED : transaction which is already committed and will be ended soon.
    *   COMMITTING : transaction which is committing
    *   ABORTED : transaction which is rolled back and will be ended soon. 
    *   KILLED : transaction which is forcefully killed by the server.

The following shows [options] available with the **cubrid tranlist** utility.

.. program:: tranlist

  -s, --summary                print summarized information of transaction
      --sort-key=COLUMN_NUMBER column number to be sorted
      --reverse                reverse the sort result


.. option:: -s, --summary

    This option outputs only summarized information(it omits query execution information or locking information).

.. _flashback:

flashback
---------

The **cubrid flashback** utility is used to get SQL statements to rewind a specific committed transaction, and can only be executed by the **DBA** user. The system parameter **supplemental_log** must be turned on, and flashback is supported only for DML executed after the **supplemental_log** is set. ::

    cubrid flashback [options] database_name owner_name.class_name1 [owner_name.class_name2, ...]

*   **cubrid**: An integrated utility for the CUBRID service and database management.

*   **flashback**: A utility that provides statements to rewind a specific transaction.

*   *database_name*: The name of the database whose transaction is to be rewound.

*   *owner_name.class_name*: The classes to rewind. When specifying the class_name, it must be specified along with the owner name.

The following shows what information is displayed when a user runs "cubrid flashback demodb dba.tbl".

::

    $ csql -u dba demodb

    csql> CREATE TABLE tbl (a INT);
    csql> INSERT INTO tbl VALUES (10);

    $ cubrid flashback demodb dba.tbl

    Flashback Summary
    Number of Transaction: 1
    Start date - End date: 03-05-2022:10:52:56 - 03-05-2022:11:02:56
    Transaction id  User name                         Start time            End time              Num_insert  Num_update  Num_delete  Table
               135  DBA                               03-05-2022:11:02:40   03-05-2022:11:02:41            1           0           0  dba.tbl
    Enter transaction id (press -1 to quit): 135

    delete from [dba.tbl] where [a] = 10 limit 1;

In the above example, when the flashback is executed, it displays information about transactions performed within the specified time period. If users do not specify a period, the transaction history up to 10 minutes before the current time is displayed.
When the user selects a transaction ID, SQL statements are provided to execute the flashback on DML executed within the selected transaction. The user must enter the transaction ID within 300 seconds which can be adjusted using the system parameter **flashback_timeout** .

Each column's meaning in the **Flashback Summary** is as following.

    *   Transaction id : The identifier of the transaction
    *   User name : Transaction user
    *   Start time : Transaction start time (approximate time)
    *   End time :  Transaction end time
    *   Num_insert : Number of insert operations executed within the transaction
    *   Num_update : Number of update operations executed within the transaction
    *   Num_delete : Number of delete operations executed within the transaction
    *   Table : List of tables for which DMLs have been performed within the transaction

.. note:: 
		If users attempt to rewind a table on which a trigger is created, unintended results may be obtained. Users are recommended to disable triggers on the table before executing the flashback. For more information, see :ref:`alter-trigger`.

.. option:: -o, --output-file=FILE

    This option is used to store the SQL statements that can rewind a specific transaction in a specified file. If the **-o** option is not specified, the message is displayed on a console screen. ::

        cubrid flashback -o db_output demodb dba.tbl

.. option:: -u, --user=ID

    This option is used to specify the user who executed the SQL statements. If the **-u** option is not specified, then it searches for statements executed by all users. ::

        $ csql -u public demodb

        csql> CREATE TABLE tbl (a int);
        csql> INSERT INTO tbl VALUES (10);

        csql> CALL login ('dba', '') ON CLASS db_user;

        csql> INSERT INTO public.tbl VALUES (20);

        $ cubrid flashback -u public demodb dba.tbl

        Enter transaction id (press -1 to quit): 135

        delete from [public.tbl] where [a] = 10 limit 1;

.. option:: -p, --dba-password=PASSWORD

    This option specifies the password of the dba. If the **-p** option is not specified, then the password should be entered in the prompt.

.. option:: -s, --start-date=DATE

    This option specifies the start date in the dd-mm-yyyy:hh:mi:ss (e.g. 28-04-2022:14:10:00) format. It finds transactions that started after the specified time or are in progress at the specified time among committed transactions. ::

        cubrid flashback -s 28-04-2022:14:10:00 demodb dba.tbl

.. option:: -e, --end-date=DATE

    This option specifies the end date in the dd-mm-yyyy:hh:mi:ss (e.g. 28-04-2022:14:10:00) format. It finds transactions that have committed before the specified time.

    If no start date is specified, the start date is set to the value of 10 minutes before the end date. Also, if an end date is not specified, the end date is set to 10 minutes after the start date.
    If neither start date nor end date is set, transactions performed up to 10 minutes before the current time are searched for. ::

        cubrid flashback -e 28-04-2022:14:10:00 demodb dba.tbl

.. option:: --detail

    This option is used to display the detailed information for each SQL statement. Transaction ID, transaction user, and original SQL statements are displayed with the SQL statements for flashback. The original SQL statement is not the exact syntax user executed. It simply represents the user-executed statement as INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements that are executed row-by-row. For example, An INSERT … SELECT statement is expressed as multiple INSERT statements.
    If the **\-\-detail** option is not specified, only the SQL statements for flashback is displayed. ::

        cubrid flashback --detail demodb dba.tbl

        [FLASHBACK]      delete from [dba.tbl] where [a] = 10 limit 1;

.. option:: --oldest

    This option is used to display the SQL statements executed within the specified transaction in chronological order. If the **\-\-oldest** is not specified, the SQL statements executed within the transaction are displayed in reverse chronological order. ::

        cubrid flashback --oldest demodb dba.tbl

HA Commands
-----------

**cubrid changemode** utility prints or changes the HA mode.

**cubrid applyinfo** utility prints the information of applied transaction logs in the HA environment.

For more details, see :ref:`cubrid-service-util`.

.. _locale-command:

Locale Commands
---------------

**cubrid genlocale** utility compiles the locale information to use. This utility is executed in the **make_locale.sh** script ( **.bat** for Windows).

**cubrid dumplocale** utility dumps the compiled binary locale (CUBRID locale library) file as a human-readable format on the console. It is better to save the output as a file by output redirection.

**cubrid synccolldb** utility checks if the collations between database and locale library are consistent or not, and synchronize them.

For more detailed usage, see :ref:`locale-setting`.


Timezone Commands
-----------------

**cubrid gen_tz** utility has two modes:

-   **new** mode when it compiles the IANA timezone data stored in the tzdata folder into a C source code file.
    This file is then converted into a .so shared library for Linux or .dll library for Windows using the **make_tz.sh** (Linux) / **make_tz.bat** (Windows) scripts.
-   **extend** mode is similar to new but is used when you want to update your timezone data to a different version and ensure backward compatibility
    with the old data. It is always used with a database name argument. In some situations, when it is impossible to ensure backward compatibility
    just by merging the two versions of timezone data, an update of the data in the tables of the database is done.
    It is executed using **make_tz.sh -g extend** for Linux and **make_tz.bat /extend** for Windows.
    
**cubrid dump_tz** utility dumps the compiled CUBRID timezone library file as a human-readable format on the console. It is better to save the output as a file by output redirection.
