CUBRID SHARD

Database Sharding
=================

**Horizontal partitioning**

Horizontal partition is a design to partition the data for which schema is identical, based on the row, into multiple tables and store them. For example, 'User Table' with identical schema can be divided into 'User Table #0' in which users less than 13 years are stored and 'User Table #1' in which users 13 or greater than 13 years old.

**Database sharding**

Database sharding is to store data into physically separate databases through horizontal partitioning and to retrieve them. For example, it is a method to store users less than 13 years old in database 0 and store users 13 or greater than 13 years old in database 1 when 'User Table' is located through multiple database. In addition to performance, database sharding is used to distribute and save large data which cannot be saved into one database instance.

Each partitioned database is called a shard or database shard.

**CUBRID SHARD**

The CUBRID SHARD is middleware for database sharding and its characteristics are as follows:

*   Middleware that is used to minimize changes in existing applications, allowing access to transparently sharded data by using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), a popular choice, or CUBRID C Interface (CCI), which is CUBRID C API.
*   In this function, a hint may be added to an existing query to indicate a shard in which the query would be executed.
*   It guarantees the unique characteristics of certain transactions.

.. _shard-terminologies:

CUBRID SHARD Terminologies
==========================

The terminologies used to describe CUBRID SHARD are as follows:

*   **shard DB** : A database that includes a split table and data and processes user requests
*   **shard metadata** : Configuration information for the operation of a CUBRID SHARD. It analyzes the requested query and includes information to select a shard DB which will execute a query and to create a database session with the shard DB.
*   **shard key (column)** : A column used as an identifier to select a shard in the sharding table
*   **shard key data** : A shard key value that corresponds to the hint to identify the shard from the query
*   **shard ID** : An identifier to identify a shard DB
*   **proxy** : A CUBRID middleware process that analyzes hints included in user queries and sends requests to a shard DB which will process the query, based on the analyzed hint and the shard metadata

CUBRID SHARD Main Features
==========================

Middleware Structure
--------------------

The CUBRID SHARD is middleware, positioned between an application and logically, or physically, split shards. It keeps connection with multiple applications, sends requests from applications to the appropriate shard, and returns the results to the applications.

.. image:: /images/image40.png

Generally, it uses Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) or CUBRID C Interface (CCI), an interface used to connect to the CUBRID SHARD, and processes the requests from applications. It does not require additional driver or framework, minimizing the changes in applications.

The CUBRID SHARD middleware consists of three processes (broker/proxy/CAS) and the brief features of each process are as follows:

.. image:: /images/image41.png

*   **broker**

    *   Receives the initial connection request from drivers such as JDBC/CCI and then sends the received request to the proxy based on the load balancing policy.
    *   Monitors and restores the status of the proxy process and the CAS process.

*   **proxy**

    *   Sends the user request from the driver and then returns the processing result to the application.
    *   Manages the connection between the driver and the CAS and processes transactions.

*   **CAS**

    *   Creates a connection with the split shard DB and processes the user request received from the proxy by using the connection.
    *   Processes transactions.

Selecting a Shard DB through the Shard SQL Hint
-----------------------------------------------

**Shard SQL Hint**

With the hints and configuration data included in a SQL hint statement, the CUBRID SHARD selects a shard DB that will process the requests from applications. The types of available SQL hints are as follows:

+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| SQL hint             | Description                                                                                                                        |
+======================+====================================================================================================================================+
| **/*+ shard_key */** | A hint to specify the position of the bind variable or literal value that corresponds to the shard key column.                     |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **/*+ shard_val(**   | A hint to explicitly specify the shard key within the hint when there is no column that corresponds to the shard key in the query. |
| *value*              |                                                                                                                                    |
| **) */**             |                                                                                                                                    |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **/*+ shard_id(**    | A hint used when a user specifies a shard DB to process queries.                                                                   |
| *shard_id*           |                                                                                                                                    |
| **) */**             |                                                                                                                                    |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The terms are summarized as shown below: For more information on shard terms, see :ref:`shard-terminologies`.

*   **shard key** : A column to distinguish shard DBs. In general, this column exists in all or most tables in a shard DB and has a unique value.
*   **shard id** : An identifier that can be used to logically distinguish shards. For example, when one DB is split into four shard DBs, there are four shard IDs.

For more information on the query process using hints and configuration information, see :ref:`General Procedure of Executing Queries by Using Shard SQL Hint <using-shard-hint>`.

.. note::

    *   When more than one shard hint exist on a query, it works normally if shard hints indicate the same shards, but it fails if each of them indicates the different shard. 
    
        ::

            SELECT * FROM student WHERE shard_key = /*+ shard_key */ 250 OR shard_key = /*+ shard_key */ 22;

        On the above case, it works normally if the shard keys 250 and 22 indicate the same shard, but it fails if they indicate the different shards.

    *   On some driver functions which batches the queries with an array by binding the several values(ex. PreparedStatement.executeBatch in JDBC, cci_execute_array in CCI), if at least the one which accesses to the other shard exists, all executions of the queries fail.

    *   Functions to run several statements at one time on shard environment(ex. Statement.executeBatch in JDBC, cci_execute_batch in CCI) will be supported later.

**shard_key Hint**

The **shard_key** hint is to specify the position of a bind or literal variable. This hint should be positioned in front of either of them.

Ex) Specifies the position of a bind variable. Executes the query in the shard DB corresponding to the student_no value that would be bound when executed.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT name FROM student WHERE student_no = /*+ shard_key */ ?;

Ex) Specifies the position of a literal value. Executes the query in the shard DB corresponding to the student_no value (the literal value) that is 123 when executed.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT name FROM student WHERE student_no = /*+ shard_key */ 123;

**shard_val Hint**

The **shard_val** hint is used when there is no shard column that can be used to identify the shard DB in the query. It sets the shard key column as the value of the **shard_val** hint. The **shard_val** hint can be positioned anywhere in an SQL statement.

Ex) When the shard key is not included in the student_no or in the query, the query is performed in the shard DB in which the shard key (student_no) is 123.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT age FROM student WHERE name =? /*+ shard_val(123) */;

**shard_id Hint**

Regardless of the shard key column value, the **shard_id** hint can be used when the user specifies a shard for query execution. The **shard_id** hint can be positioned anywhere in an SQL statement.

Ex) When the query is performed in shard DB #3, queries students whose value of age is greater than 17 in the shard DB #3.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM student WHERE age > 17 /*+ shard_id(3) */;

.. _using-shard-hint:

**General Procedure of Executing Queries by Using Shard SQL Hint**

#.  Executing Queries

    The following shows how a user-requested query is executed.

    .. image:: /images/image42.png

    *   An application makes a request for a query to the CUBRID SHARD through the JDBC interface. It adds the **shard_key** hint to the SQL statement to specify the shard DB from where the query will be executed.

    *   The SQL hint, like the example above, in the SQL statement, should be positioned in front of the bind variable or literal value of the column specified by the shard key.

    The shard SQL hint configured by the bind variable is as follows:

    .. image:: /images/image43.png

    The shard SQL hint specified in the literal value is as follows:

    .. image:: /images/image44.png

#.  Select a Shard DB to Analyze and Perform a Query

    Select a shard DB to analyze and perform the query by following the steps below:

    .. image:: /images/image45.png

    *   SQL queries received from users are rewritten in the format that is appropriate for internal processing.
    *   Select the shard DB that executed the query by using the SQL statement and hint requested by the user.

        *   When the SQL hint is set in the bind variable, select the shard DB which will execute the query by using the result of hashing the value of the shard_key bind variable and the configuration information.

        *   The hash function can be specified by the user. If not specified, the shard_key value is hashed by using the default hash function. Default hash functions are as follows:

        *   When the shard_key is an integer

            ::

                Default hash function (shard_key) = shard_key mod SHARD_KEY_MODULAR parameter (default value 256)

        *   When the shard_key is a string

            ::

                Default hash function (shard_key) = shard_key[0] mod  SHARD_KEY_MODULAR parameter (default value 256)

    .. note::

        When the shard_key bind variable value is 100, "Default hash function (shard_key) = 100 % 256 = 100." Therefore, the shard DB #1 (the hash result is 100) will be selected and then the user request will be sent to the selected shard DB #1.

#.  Return the Query Execution Result

    Return the query execution result as follows:

    .. image:: /images/image46.png

    *   Receives the query execution result from the shard DB #1 and then returns it to the requested application.
        
.. note::

    On the driver functions which do a batch query processing with the array which binds several values(ex. executeBatch in JDBC, cci_execute_array and cci_execute_batch in CCI ), they fail to run if there is a value which accesses to a different shard.

Transaction Support
-------------------

**Transaction Processing**

The CUBRID SHARD executes an internal processing procedure to guarantee atomicity among ACID. For example, when an exception such as abnormal termination of an application occurs, the CUBRID SHARD sends a request to rollback to the shard DB which has been processing the request from the application in order to invalidate all changes in the transaction.

The ACID, the characteristic of general transactions, is guaranteed, based on the characteristics and settings of the backend DBMS.

**Constraints**

2 Phase Commit (2PC) is unavailable; therefore, an error occurs when a query is executed by using several shard DBs in a single transaction.

Quick Start
===========

Configuration Example
---------------------

The CUBRID SHARD to be explained consists of four CUBRID SHARD DBs as shown below. The application uses the JDBC interface to process user requests.

.. image:: /images/image49.png

**Start after creating the shard DB and user account**

As shown in the example above, after each shard DB node creates a shard DB and a user account, it starts the instance of the database.

*   shard DB name: *shard1*
*   shard DB user account: *shard*
*   shard DB user password: *shard123*

::

    sh> # Creating CUBRID SHARD DB
    sh> cubrid createdb shard1 en_US

    sh> # Creating CUBRID SHARD user account
    sh> csql -S -u dba shard1 -c "create user shard password 'shard123'"

    sh> # Starting CUBRID SHARD DB
    sh> cubrid server start shard1

Changing the shard Configurations
---------------------------------

**cubrid_broker.conf**

Change **cubrid_broker.conf** as shown below by referring to **cubrid_broker.conf.shard**:

.. warning:: The port number and the shared memory identifier should be appropriately changed to the value which has not been assigned by the system.

::

    SHARD_CONNECTION_FILE   =shard_connection.txt
    SHARD_KEY_FILE          =shard_key.txt

For CUBRID, the server port number is not separately configured in the **shard_connection.txt** but the **cubrid_port_id** parameter of the **cubrid.conf** configuration file is used. Therefore, set the **cubrid_port_id** parameter of the **cubrid.conf** identical to the server. ::

    # TCP port id for the CUBRID programs (used by all clients).
    cubrid_port_id=41523

**shard_key.txt**

Set **shard_key.txt**, the shard DB mapping configuration file, for the shard key hash value as follows:

*   [%shard_key]: Sets the shard key section
*   Executing the query at shard #0 when the shard key hash result created by default hash function is between 0 and 63
*   Executing the query at shard #1 when the shard key hash result created by default hash function is between 64 and 127
*   Executing the query at shard #2 when the shard key hash result created by default hash function is between 128 and 191
*   Executing the query at the shard #3 when the shard key hash result created by default hash function is between 192 and 255

::

    [%shard_key]
    #min    max     shard_id
    0       63      0
    64      127     1
    128     191     2
    192     255     3

**shard_connection.txt**

Configure the **shard_connection.txt** file which is shard database configuration file, as follows:

*   Real database name and connection information of shard #0
*   Real database name and connection information of shard #1
*   Real database name and connection information of shard #2
*   Real database name and connection information of shard #3

::

    # shard-id  real-db-name  connection-info
    #                         * cubrid : hostname, hostname, ...
    0           shard1        HostA

**Starting CUBRID SHARD**

To use CUBRID SHARD feature, start the CUBRID SHARD as shown below: ::

    sh> cubrid broker start
    @ cubrid broker start
    ++ cubrid broker start: success

**Retrieving the CUBRID SHARD Status**

Retrieve the CUBRID SHARD status as follows to check the parameter and the status of the process. ::

Writing a Sample
----------------

Check that the CUBRID SHARD operates normally by using a simple Java program.

**Writing a Sample Table**

Write a temporary table for the example in all shard DBs. ::

    sh> csql -C -u shard -p 'shard123' shard1@localhost -c "create table student (s_no int, s_name varchar, s_age int, primary key(s_no))"

**Writing Code**

The following example program is to enter student information from 0 to 1023 to the shard DB. Check the **cubrid_broker.conf** modified in the previous procedure and then set the address/port information and the user information into the connection url.

.. _shard-configuration:

Architecture and Configuration
==============================

Architecture
------------

The CUBRID SHARD is middleware, consisting of a broker, proxy, and CAS process as shown below.

.. image:: /images/image50.png

.. _default-shard-conf:

Configuration
-------------

To use the CUBRID SHARD feature, the parameters needed to run SHARD related processes, shard connection file(SHARD_CONNECTION_FILE) and shard key file(SHARD_KEY_FILE) should be configured.

cubrid_broker.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **cubrid_broker.conf** file is used for setting the CUBRID SHARD feature. Refer to **cubrid_broker.conf.shard** when configuring **cubrid_broker.conf**. For details of **cubrid_broker.conf**, see :ref:`broker-configuration`.

.. _shard-connection-file:

Shard Connection File(SHARD_CONNECTION_FILE)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To connect to the backend shard DB, the CUBRID SHARD loads the shard connection configuration file specified in the **SHARD_CONNECTION_FILE** parameter of **cubrid_broker.conf**.

The shard DB can be set until 256 shards.

If **SHARD_CONNECTION_FILE** is not specified in **cubrid_broker.conf**, it loads the **shard_connection.txt** file by default.

**Format**

The basic example and format of a shard connection configuration file are as follows: ::

    #
    # shard-id      real-db-name    connection-info
    #                               * cubrid : hostname, hostname, ...
     
    # CUBRID
    0               shard1          HostA  
    1               shard1          HostB
    2               shard1          HostC
    3               shard1          HostD
     
.. note:: As shown in the general CUBRID settings, the content after # is converted to comment.

**CUBRID**

When the backend shard DB is CUBRID, the format of the connection configuration file is as follows: ::

    # CUBRID
    # shard-id      real-db-name            connection-info
    # shard identifier( >0 )        The real name of backend shard DB    host name

    0           shard_db_1          host1
    1           shard_db_2          host2
    2           shard_db_3          host3
    3           shard_db_4          host4

For CUBRID, a separate backend shard DB port number is not specified in the above configuration file, but the **CUBRID_PORT_ID** parameter in the **cubrid.conf** file is used. The **cubrid.conf** file is by default located in the **$CUBRID/conf**. ::

    $ vi cubrid.conf

    ...

    # TCP port id for the CUBRID programs (used by all clients).
    cubrid_port_id=41523

.. _shard-key-configuration-file:

Shard key file(SHARD_KEY_FILE)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CUBRID SHARD loads the shard key configuration file specified in the **SHARD_KEY_FILE** parameter of **cubrid_broker.conf** to determine which backend shard DB should process the user requests.

If **SHARD_KEY_FILE** is not specified in **cubrid_broker.conf**, it loads the **shard_key.txt** file by default.

**Format**

The example and format of a shard key configuration file are as follows: ::

    [%student_no]
    #min    max     shard_id
    0       31      0   
    32      63      1   
    64      95      2   
    96      127     3   
    128     159     0
    160     191     1
    192     223     2
    224     255     3

*   [%shard_key_name]: Specifies the name of the shard key.
*   min: The minimum value range of the shard key hash results.
*   max: The maximum range of the shard key hash results.
*   shard_id: The shard identifier

.. note:: As shown in the general CUBRID settings, the content after # is converted to comment.

.. warning::

    *   min of the shard key should always start from 0.
    *   max should be up to 255.
    *   No empty value between min and max is allowed.
    *   The default hash function should not exceed the value of the **SHARD_KEY_MODULAR** parameter(min. 1, max 256).
    *   The result of shard key hashing should be within a range from 0 to (**SHARD_KEY_MODULAR** -1).

.. _setting-user-defined-hash-function:

Setting User-Defined Hash Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To select a shard that will perform queries, the CUBRID SHARD uses the results of hashing the shard key and the metadata configuration information. For this, users can use the default hash function or define a hash function.

**Default Hash Function**

When the **SHARD_KEY_LIBRARY_NAME** and **SHARD_KEY_FUNCTION_NAME** parameters of **cubrid_broker.conf** are not set, the shard key is hashed by using the default hash function. The default hash function is as follows:

*   When the shard_key is an integer

    ::

        Default hash function (shard_key) = shard_key mod SHARD_KEY_MODULAR parameter (default value: 256)

*   When the shard_key is a string

    ::

        Default hash function (shard_key) = shard_key[0] mod SHARD_KEY_MODULAR parameter (default value: 256)

**Setting User-Defined Hash Function**

The CUBRID SHARD can hash the shard key by using the user-defined hash function, in addition to the default hash function.

    **Implementing and Creating a Library**

    The user-defined hash function must be implemented as a **.so** library loadable at runtime. Its prototype is as shown below:

    .. code-block:: c

        /*
           return value :
                success - shard key id(>0)
                fail    - invalid argument(ERROR_ON_ARGUMENT), shard key id make fail(ERROR_ON_MAKE_SHARD_KEY)
           type         : shard key value type
           val          : shard key value
        */
        typedef int (*FN_GET_SHARD_KEY) (const char *shard_key, T_SHARD_U_TYPE type,
                                           const void *val, int val_size);

    *   The return value of the hash function should be within the range of the hash results of the **shard_key.txt** configuration file.
    *   To build a library, the **$CUBRID/include/shard_key.h** file of the CUBRID source must be included. The file lets you know the details such as error code that can be returned.

    **Changing the cubrid_broker.conf Configuration File**

    To apply a user-defined hash function, the **SHARD_KEY_LIBRARY_NAME** and **SHARD_KEY_FUNCTION_NAME** parameters of **cubrid_broker.conf** should be set according to the implementation.

    *   **SHARD_KEY_LIBRARY_NAME** : The (absolute) path of the user-defined hash library.
    *   **SHARD_KEY_FUNCTION_NAME** : The name of the user-defined hash function.

    **Example**

    The following example shows how to use a user-defined hash. First, check the **shard_key.txt** configuration file. ::

        [%student_no]
        #min    max     shard_id
        0       31      0   
        32      63      1   
        64      95      2   
        96      127     3   
        128     159     0
        160     191     1
        192     223     2
        224     255     3

    To set the user-defined hash function, implement a **.so** shared library that is loadable at runtime. The result of the hash function should be within the range of hash function results defined in the **shard_key.txt** configuration file. The following example shows a simple implementation.

    *   When the shard_key is an integer

        *   Select shard #0 when the shard_key is an odd number
        *   Select shard #1 when the shard_key is an even number

    *   When the shard_key is a string

        *   Select shard #0 when the shard_key string starts with 'a' or 'A'.
        *   Select shard #1 when the shard_key string starts with 'b' or 'B'.
        *   Select shard #2 when the shard_key string starts with 'c' or 'C'.
        *   Select shard #3 when the shard_key string starts with 'd' or 'D'.

        {
          unsigned int ival;
          unsigned char c;
        
          if (value == NULL)
            {
              return ERROR_ON_ARGUMENT;
            }
        
          switch (type)
            {
            case SHARD_U_TYPE_INT:
              ival = (unsigned int) (*(unsigned int *) value);
              if (ival % 2)
                {
                  return 32;            // shard #1
                }
              else
                {
                  return 0;             // shard #0
                }
              break;
        
            case SHARD_U_TYPE_STRING:
              c = (unsigned char) (((unsigned char *) value)[0]);
              switch (c)
                {
                case 'a':
                case 'A':
                  return 0;             // shard #0
                case 'b':
                case 'B':
                  return 32;            // shard #1
                case 'c':
                case 'C':
                  return 64;            // shard #2
                case 'd':
                case 'D':
                  return 96;            // shard #3
                default:
                  return ERROR_ON_ARGUMENT;
                }
        
              break;
        
            default:
              return ERROR_ON_ARGUMENT;
            }
          return ERROR_ON_MAKE_SHARD_KEY;
        }

    Build the user-defined function as a shared library. The following example is Makefile for building a hash function. ::

        # Makefile
         
        CC = gcc
        LIBS = $(LIB_FLAG)
        CFLAGS = $(CFLAGS_COMMON) -fPIC -I$(CUBRID)/include -I$(CUBRID_SRC)/src/broker
         
        SHARD_CC = gcc -g -shared -Wl,-soname,shard_key_udf.so
        SHARD_KEY_UDF_OBJS = shard_key_udf.o
         
        all:$(SHARD_KEY_UDF_OBJS)
                $(SHARD_CC) $(CFLAGS) -o shard_key_udf.so $(SHARD_KEY_UDF_OBJS) $(LIBS)
         
        clean:
                -rm -f *.o core shard_key_udf.so

    To include the user-defined hash function, modify the **SHARD_KEY_LIBRARY_NAME** and **SHARD_KEY_FUNCTION_NAME** parameters as shown in the above implementation. ::

        [%student_no]
        SHARD_KEY_LIBRARY_NAME =$CUBRID/conf/shard_key_udf.so
        SHARD_KEY_FUNCTION_NAME =fn_shard_key_udf

    .. note:: 
    
        *   When you define a user's hash function in the application, 16bit(short), 32bit(int) and 64bit(INT64) integer can be used as the value of shard key.
        *   The user should define a hash function when you have to use VARCHAR type.

Constraints
===========

**Linux only support**

CUBRID SHARD feature can be used only in Linux.

**One transaction can be run on only one shard DB**

One transaction should be performed within only one shard DB, so the following constraints exist.

*   It is unavailable to change data in several shard DBs through changing the shard key (**UPDATE**). If necessary, use **DELETE** / **INSERT**.
*   A query about more than one shard DB, such as join, sub-query, or, union, group by, between, like, in, exist, or any/some/all, is not supported.

**Session information is valid only in each shard DB**

Session information is valid within each shard DB only. Therefore, the results from session-related functions such as :func:`LAST_INSERT_ID` may be different from the intended result.

**No support SET NAMES statement**

In SHARD environment, SET NAMES statement is not recommended to use because it can work abnormally.

**auto increment is valid only in each shard DB**

The auto increment attribute or SERIAL is valid within each shard DB only. So a result different from the intended result may be returned.
