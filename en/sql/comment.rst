The CSQL Interpreter is a SQL-style method; the SQL-style comment starts with the double dashes (--) and the comment line after the double dashes are regarded as comment. Additionally, it supports C++ style, which starts with double slashes (//),Â and C-style, which starts and ends with '/*' and '*/' respectively.

The following are examples of comments supported in the CSQL Interpreter.
