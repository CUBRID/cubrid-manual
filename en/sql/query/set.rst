SET
***

The **SET** statement is the syntax that specifies a system parameter's value or user-defined variables.

System Parameter
================

You can define a value of a system parameter with SQL syntax by CSQL interpreter or a query editor of CUBRID Manager. However, be cautious that updatable parameters are limited. For the information of updatable parameters, see :ref:`cubrid-conf`.

::

    SET SYSTEM PARAMETERS 'parameter_name=value [{; name=value}...]'

**DEFAULT** for *value* will reset the parameter to its default value with an exception of **call_stack_dump_activation_list** parameter. 

.. code-block:: sql

    SET SYSTEM PARAMETERS 'lock_timeout=DEFAULT';
    
User Variables
==============

You can create user-defined variables in two ways. One is to use the **SET** statement and the other is to use the assignment statement of user-defined variables within SQL statements. You can delete the user-defined variables that you defined with the **DEALLOCATE** or the **DROP** statements.

The user-defined variables are also called session variables as they are used for maintaining connections within one application. The user-defined variables are used within the part of a connection session, and the user-defined variables defined by an application cannot be accessed by other applications. When an application terminates connections, all variables will be removed automatically. The user-defined variables are limited to twenty per connection session for an application. If you already have twenty user-defined variables and want to define a new user-defined variable, you must remove some variables with the **DROP VARIABLE** statement.

You can use user-defined variables in most SQL statements. If you define user-defined variables and refer to them in one statement, the sequence is not guaranteed. That is, if you refer to the variables specified in the **SELECT** list of the **HAVING**, **GROUP BY** or **ORDER BY** clause, you may not get the values in the sequence you expect. You cannot also use user-defined variables as identifiers, such as column names or table names within SQL statements

The user-defined variables are not case-sensitive. The user-defined variable type can be one of the **SHORT**, **INTEGER**, **BIGINT**, **FLOAT**, **DOUBLE**, **NUMERIC**, **CHAR**, **VARCHAR**, **BIT** and **BIT VARYING**. Other types will be converted to the **VARCHAR** type.

.. code-block:: sql

    SET @v1 = 1, @v2=CAST(1 AS BIGINT), @v3 = '123', @v4 = DATE'2010-01-01';
     
    SELECT typeof(@v1), typeof(@v2), typeof(@v3), typeof(@v4);
     
::

       typeof(@v1)         typeof(@v2)         typeof(@v3)         typeof(@v4)
    ======================================================================================
      'integer'           'bigint'            'character (-1)'    'character varying (1073741823)

The user-defined variables can be changed when you define values.

.. code-block:: sql

    SET @v = 'a'; 
    SET @v1 = 10;

    SELECT @v := 1, typeof(@v1), @v1:='1', typeof(@v1);
     
::

      @v := 1                typeof(@v1)          @v1 := '1'             typeof(@v1)
    ======================================================================================
      1                     'integer'             '1'                    'character (-1)'

::

    <set_statement>
            : <set_statement>, <udf_assignment>
            | SET <udv_assignment>
            ;
     
    <udv_assignment>
            : @<name> = <expression>
            | @<name> := <expression>
            ;
     
    {DEALLOCATE|DROP} VARIABLE <variable_name_list>
    <variable_name_list>
           : <variable_name_list> ',' @<name>

*   You must define the variable names with alphanumeric characters and underscores (_).
*   When you define the variables within SQL statements, you should use the ':=' operator.

The following example shows how to define the variable a and assign a value 1 to it.

.. code-block:: sql

    SET @a = 1;
    SELECT @a;

::

      @a
    ======================
      1

The following example shows how to count the number of rows in the **SELECT** statement by using the user-defined variable.

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE TABLE t (i INTEGER);
    INSERT INTO t(i) VALUES(2),(4),(6),(8);
     
    SET @a = 0;
     
    SELECT @a := @a+1 AS row_no, i FROM t;

::

      row_no                          i
     ===================================
      1                               2
      2                               4
      3                               6
      4                               8
      
    4 rows selected.

The following example shows how to use the user-defined variable as the input of bind parameter specified in the prepared statement.

.. code-block:: sql

    SET @a:=3;
     
    PREPARE stmt FROM 'SELECT i FROM t WHERE i < ?';
    EXECUTE stmt USING @a;

::

                i
    =============
                2

The following example shows how to declare the user-defined variable by using the ':=' operator.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT @a := 1, @user_defined_variable := 'user defined variable';
    UPDATE t SET i = (@var := 1);

The following example shows how to delete the user-defined variable *a* and *user_defined_variable*.

.. code-block:: sql

    DEALLOCATE VARIABLE @a, @user_defined_variable;
    DROP VARIABLE @a, @user_defined_variable;

.. note:: \

    The user-defined variables that are defined by the **SET** statement start by connecting an application to a server and will be maintained until the application terminates the connection. The connection maintained during this period is called a session. When an application terminates the connection or when there are no requests for a certain period of time, the session will expire, and the user-defined variables will be deleted as a result. You can set the session time with the **session_state_timeout** parameter of **cubrid.conf**; the default value is **21600** seconds (=6 hours).

    The data managed by the session includes **PREPARE** statements, the user-defined variables, the last ID inserted (**LAST_INSERT_ID**) and the number of rows affected by the statement that you execute at the end (**ROW_COUNT**).
