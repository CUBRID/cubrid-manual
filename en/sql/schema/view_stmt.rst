CREATE VIEW
===========

A view is a virtual table that does not exist physically. You can create a view by using an existing table or a query. **VIEW** and **VCLASS** are used interchangeably.

Use **CREATE VIEW** statement to create a view. Regarding writing view name, see :doc:`/sql/identifier`. 

::

    CREATE [OR REPLACE] {VIEW | VCLASS} view_name
    [<subclass_definition>]
    [(view_column_name [COMMENT 'column_comment_string'], ...)]
    [INHERIT <resolution>, ...]
    [AS <select_statement>]
    [WITH CHECK OPTION] 
    [COMMENT [=] 'view_comment_string'];
                                    
        <subclass_definition> ::= {UNDER | AS SUBCLASS OF} table_name, ...
        <resolution> ::= [CLASS | TABLE] {column_name} OF superclass_name [AS alias]

*   **OR REPLACE**: If the keyword **OR REPLACE** is specified after **CREATE**, the existing view is replaced by a new one without displaying any error message, even when the *view_name* overlaps with the existing view name.

*   *view_name*: specifies the name of a view to be created. It must be unique in a database.
*   *view_column_name*: defines the column of a view.
*   **AS** <*select_statement*>: A valid **SELECT** statement must be specified. A view is created based on this.
*   **WITH CHECK OPTION**: If this option is specified, the update or insert operation is possible only when the condition specified in the **WHERE** clause of the <*select_statement*> is satisfied. Therefore, this option is used to disallow the update of a virtual table that violates the condition.
*   *view_comment_string*: specifies a view's comment.
*   *column_comment_string*: specofies a column's comment.

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE TABLE a_tbl (
        id INT NOT NULL,
        phone VARCHAR(10)
    );
    INSERT INTO a_tbl VALUES(1,'111-1111'), (2,'222-2222'), (3, '333-3333'), (4, NULL), (5, NULL);
    
    --creating a new view based on AS select_statement from a_tbl
    CREATE VIEW b_view AS SELECT * FROM a_tbl WHERE phone IS NOT NULL WITH CHECK OPTION;
    SELECT * FROM b_view;
     
::

               id  phone
    ===================================
                1  '111-1111'
                2  '222-2222'
                3  '333-3333'
     
.. code-block:: sql

    --WITH CHECK OPTION doesn't allow updating column value which violates WHERE clause
    UPDATE b_view SET phone=NULL;
     
::

    ERROR: Check option exception on view b_view.

The below updates the old view's definition, In addition, this adds a view's comment.

.. code-block:: sql

    --creating view which name is as same as existing view name
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW b_view AS SELECT * FROM a_tbl ORDER BY id DESC COMMENT 'changed view';
     
    --the existing view has been replaced as a new view by OR REPLACE keyword
    SELECT * FROM b_view;
     
::

               id  phone
    ===================================
                5  NULL
                4  NULL
                3  '333-3333'
                2  '222-2222'
                1  '111-1111'

The below adds a comment to a view's columns.

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW b_view(a COMMENT 'column id', b COMMENT 'column phone') AS SELECT * FROM a_tbl ORDER BY id DESC;

Condition for Creating Updatable VIEW
-------------------------------------

A virtual table is updatable if it satisfies the following conditions:

*   The **FROM** clause must include the updatable table or view only.

    In versions lower than CUBRID 9.0, only one updatable table can be included to the **FROM** clause it requires. However, two tables in parentheses like FROM (class_x, class_y) can be updated since the two were expressed as one table. In version of CUBRID 9.0 or higher, more than one updatable table is allowed. The **FROM** clause must include only one table or updatable view. However, two tables included in parentheses as in **FROM** (class_x, class_y) can be updated because they represent one table.

*   A **JOIN** syntax can be included.

    .. note:: In versions lower than CUBRID 10.0, you cannot update a view which is created with a **JOIN** syntax.

*   The **DISTINCT** or **UNIQUE** statement should not be included.
*   The **GROUP BY... HAVING** statement should not be included.
*   Aggregate functions such as **SUM** or **AVG** should not be included.
*   The entire query must consist of queries that can be updated by **UNION ALL**, not by **UNION**. However, the table should exist only in one of the queries that constitute **UNION ALL**.
*   If a record is inserted into a view created by using the **UNION ALL** statement, the system determines into which table the record will be inserted. This cannot be done by the user. To control this, the user must manually insert the row or create a separate view for insertion.

Even when all rules above are satisfied, columns that contains following contents cannot be updated.

*   Path expressions (example: *tbl_name.col_name*)
*   Numeric type column that includes an arithmetic operator

Even though the column defined in the view is updatable, a view can be updated only when an appropriate update authorization is granted on the table included in the **FROM** clause. Also there must be an access authorization to a view. The way to grant an access authorization to a view is the same to grant an access authorization to a table. For details on granting authorization, see :ref:`granting-authorization`.

View's COMMENT
--------------

You can specify a view's comment as follows.

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW b_view AS SELECT * FROM a_tbl ORDER BY id DESC COMMENT 'changed view';

You can see the specified comment of a view by running this syntax.

.. code-block:: sql

    SHOW CREATE VIEW view_name;
    SELECT vclass_name, comment from db_vclass;

Or you can see the view's comment with ;sc command which displays the schema in the CSQL interpreter.

.. code-block:: sql

    $ csql -u dba demodb
    
    csql> ;sc b_view

Also, you can add a comment for each column of the view.

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW b_view (a COMMENT 'a comment', b COMMENT 'b comment') 
    AS SELECT * FROM a_tbl ORDER BY id DESC COMMENT 'view comment';
    
To see how to change a comment of a view, refer to ALTER VIEW syntax on the below.

ALTER VIEW
==========

ADD QUERY Clause
----------------

You can add a new query to a query specification by using the **ADD QUERY** clause of the **ALTER VIEW** statement. 1 is assigned to the query defined when a virtual table was created, and 2 is assigned to the query added by the **ADD QUERY** clause. ::

    ALTER [VIEW | VCLASS] view_name
    ADD QUERY <select_statement>
    [INHERIT <resolution> , ...] ;
     
        <resolution> ::= {column_name} OF superclass_name [AS alias]

*   *view_name*: specifies the name of a view where the query to be added.
*   <*select_statement*>: specifies the query to be added.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM b_view;
     
::

               id  phone
    ===================================
                1  '111-1111'
                2  '222-2222'
                3  '333-3333'
                4  NULL
                5  NULL
     
.. code-block:: sql
     
    ALTER VIEW b_view ADD QUERY SELECT * FROM a_tbl WHERE id IN (1,2);
    SELECT * FROM b_view;
     
::

               id  phone
    ===================================
                1  '111-1111'
                2  '222-2222'
                3  '333-3333'
                4  NULL
                5  NULL
                1  '111-1111'
                2  '222-2222'

AS SELECT Clause
----------------

You can change the **SELECT** query defined in the virtual table by using the **AS SELECT** clause in the **ALTER VIEW** statement. This function is working like the **CREATE OR REPLACE** statement. You can also change the query by specifying the query number 1 in the **CHANGE QUERY** clause of the **ALTER VIEW** statement. ::

    ALTER [VIEW | VCLASS] view_name AS <select_statement> ;

*   *view_name*: specifies the name of a view to be modified.
*   <*select_statement*>: specifies the new query statement to replace the **SELECT** statement defined when a view is created.

.. code-block:: sql

    ALTER VIEW b_view AS SELECT * FROM a_tbl WHERE phone IS NOT NULL;
    SELECT * FROM b_view;
     
::

               id  phone
    ===================================
                1  '111-1111'
                2  '222-2222'
                3  '333-3333'

CHANGE QUERY Clause
-------------------

You can change the query defined in the query specification by using the **CHANGE QUERY** clause reserved word of the **ALTER VIEW** statement. ::

    ALTER [VIEW | VCLASS] view_name
    CHANGE QUERY [integer] <select_statement> ;

*   *view_name*: specifies the name of a view to be modified.
*   *integer*: specifies the number value of the query to be modified. The default value is 1.
*   <*select_statement*>: specifies the new query statement to replace the query whose query number is *integer*.

.. code-block:: sql

    --adding select_statement which query number is 2 and 3 for each
    ALTER VIEW b_view ADD QUERY SELECT * FROM a_tbl WHERE id IN (1,2);
    ALTER VIEW b_view ADD QUERY SELECT * FROM a_tbl WHERE id = 3;
    SELECT * FROM b_view;
     
::

               id  phone
    ===================================
                1  '111-1111'
                2  '222-2222'
                3  '333-3333'
                4  NULL
                5  NULL
                1  '111-1111'
                2  '222-2222'
                3  '333-3333'
     
.. code-block:: sql

    --altering view changing query number 2
    ALTER VIEW b_view CHANGE QUERY 2 SELECT * FROM a_tbl WHERE phone IS NULL;
    SELECT * FROM b_view;
     
::

               id  phone
    ===================================
                1  '111-1111'
                2  '222-2222'
                3  '333-3333'
                4  NULL
                5  NULL
                4  NULL
                5  NULL
                3  '333-3333'

DROP QUERY Clause
-----------------

You can drop a query defined in the query specification by using the **DROP QUERY** of the **ALTER VIEW** statement.

.. code-block:: sql

    ALTER VIEW b_view DROP QUERY 2,3;
    SELECT * FROM b_view;
     
::

               id  phone
    ===================================
                1  '111-1111'
                2  '222-2222'
                3  '333-3333'
                4  NULL
                5  NULL

COMMENT Clause
--------------

You can change a view's comment with **COMMENT** clause of **ALTER VIEW** syntax.

::

    ALTER [VIEW | VCLASS] view_name COMMENT [=] 'view_comment';

.. code-block:: sql

    ALTER VIEW b_view COMMENT = 'changed view comment';

DROP VIEW
=========

You can drop a view by using the **DROP VIEW** clause. The way to drop a view is the same as to drop a regular table.  If you also specify IF EXISTS clause, no error will be happened even if a target view does not exist. ::

    DROP [VIEW | VCLASS] [IF EXISTS] view_name [{ ,view_name , ... }] ;

*   *view_name*: specifies the name of a view to be dropped.

.. code-block:: sql

    DROP VIEW b_view;

RENAME VIEW
===========

You can change the view name by using the **RENAME VIEW** statement. ::

    RENAME [VIEW | VCLASS] old_view_name {AS | TO} new_view_name[, old_view_name {AS | TO} new_view_name, ...] ;

*   *old_view_name*: specifies the name of a view to be modified.
*   *new_view_name*: specifies the new name of a view.

The following example shows how to rename a view name to *game_2004*.

.. code-block:: sql

    RENAME VIEW game_2004 AS info_2004;
