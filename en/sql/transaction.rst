:meta-description: This chapter covers issues relating to concurrency (MVCC) and restore, as well as how to commit or rollback transactions in CUBRID database.

.. _database-transaction:

Database Transaction
====================

A database transaction groups CUBRID queries into a unit of consistency (for ensuring valid results in multi-user environment) and restore (for making the results of committed transactions permanent and ensuring that the aborted transactions are canceled in the database despite any failure, such as system failure). A transaction is a collection of one or more queries that access and update the database.

CUBRID allows multiple users to access the database simultaneously and manages accesses and updates to prevent inconsistency of the database. For example, if data is updated by one user, the changes made by this transaction are not seen to other users or the database until the updates are committed. This principle is important because the transaction can be rolled back without being committed.

You can delay permanent updates to the database until you are confident of the transaction result. Also, you can remove (**ROLLBACK**) all updates in the database if an unsatisfactory result or failure occurs in the application or computer system during the transaction. The end of the transaction is determined by the **COMMIT WORK** or **ROLLBACK WORK** statement. The **COMMIT WORK** statement makes all updates permanent while the **ROLLBACK WORK** statement cancels all updates entered in the transaction.

Transaction Commit
------------------

Updates that occurred in the database are not permanently stored until the **COMMIT WORK** statement is executed. "Permanently stored" means that storing the updates in the disk is completed; The **WORK** keyword can be omitted. In addition, other users of the database cannot see the updates until they are permanently applied. For example, when a new row is inserted into a class, only the user who inserted the row can access it until the database transaction is committed.

All locks obtained by the transaction are released after the transaction is committed. ::

    COMMIT [WORK];

.. code-block:: sql

    -- ;autocommit off
    -- AUTOCOMMIT IS OFF
    
    SELECT name, seats
    FROM stadium WHERE code IN (30138, 30139, 30140);

::

        name                                seats
    =============================================
        'Athens Olympic Tennis Centre'      3200
        'Goudi Olympic Hall'                5000
        'Vouliagmeni Olympic Centre'        3400

The following **UPDATE** statement changes three column values of seats from the stadium. To compare the results, check the current values and names before the update is done. Since csql runs in an autocommit mode by default, the following example is executed after setting the autocommit mode to off.

.. code-block:: sql

    UPDATE stadium
    SET seats = seats + 1000
    WHERE code IN (30138, 30139, 30140);
     
    SELECT name, seats FROM stadium WHERE code in (30138, 30139, 30140);
    
::

        name                                seats
    ============================================
        'Athens Olympic Tennis Centre'      4200
        'Goudi Olympic Hall'                6000
        'Vouliagmeni Olympic Centre'        4400

If the update is properly done, the changes can be permanently fixed. In this time, use the **COMMIT WORK** as below:

.. code-block:: sql

    COMMIT [WORK];

.. note:: In CUBRID, an auto-commit mode is set by default for transaction management.

An auto-commit mode is a mode that commits or rolls back all SQL statements. The transaction is committed automatically if the SQL is executed successfully, or is rolled back automatically if an error occurs. Such auto commit modes are supported in any interfaces.

In CCI, PHP, ODBC and OLE DB interfaces, you can configure auto-commit mode by using **CCI_DEFAULT_AUTOCOMMIT** upon startup of an application. If configuration on broker parameter is omitted, the default value is set to **ON**. To change auto-commit mode, use the following functions by interface: **cci_set_autocommit** () for CCI interface and **cubrid_set_autocommit** () for PHP interface.

For session command (**;AUtocommit**) which enables auto-commit configuration in CSQL Interpreter, see :ref:`csql-session-commands`.

Transaction Rollback
--------------------

The **ROLLBACK WORK** statement removes all updates to the database since the last transaction. The **WORK** keyword can be omitted. By using this statement, you can cancel incorrect or unnecessary updates before they are permanently applied to the database. All locks obtained during the transaction are released. ::

    ROLLBACK [WORK];

The following example shows two commands that modify the definition and the row of the same table.

.. code-block:: sql

    -- csql> ;autocommit off
    CREATE TABLE code2 (
        s_name  CHAR(1),
        f_name  VARCHAR(10)
    );
    COMMIT;
    
    ALTER TABLE code2 DROP s_name;
    INSERT INTO code2 (s_name, f_name) VALUES ('D','Diamond');
 
::

    ERROR: s_name is not defined.

The **INSERT** statement fails because the *s_name* column has been dropped in the definition of *code*. The data intended to be entered to the *code* table is correct, but the *s_name* column is wrongly removed. At this point, you can use the **ROLLBACK WORK** statement to restore the original definition of the *code* table.

.. code-block:: sql

    ROLLBACK WORK;

Later, remove the *s_name* column by entering the **ALTER TABLE** again and modify the **INSERT** statement. The **INSERT** command must be entered again because the transaction has been aborted. If the database update has been done as intended, commit the transaction to make the changes permanent.

.. code-block:: sql

    ALTER TABLE code2 DROP s_name;
    INSERT INTO code2 (f_name) VALUES ('Diamond');

    COMMIT WORK;

Savepoint and Partial Rollback
------------------------------

A savepoint is established during the transaction so that database changes made by the transaction are rolled back to the specified savepoint. Such operation is called a partial rollback. In a partial rollback, database operations (insert, update, delete, etc.) after the savepoint are rolled back, and transaction operations before it are not rolled back. The transaction can proceed with other operations after the partial rollback is executed. Or the transaction can be terminated with the **COMMIT WORK** or **ROLLBACK WORK** statement. Note that the savepoint does not commit the changes made by the transaction.

A savepoint can be created at a certain point of the transaction, and multiple savepoints can be used for a certain point. If a partial rollback is executed to a savepoint before the specified savepoint or the transaction is terminated with the **COMMIT WORK** or **ROLLBACK WORK** statement, the specified savepoint is removed. The partial rollback after the specified savepoint can be performed multiple times.

Savepoints are useful because intermediate steps can be created and named to control long and complicated utilities. For example, if you use a savepoint during the update operation, you don't need to perform all statements again when you made a mistake. ::

    SAVEPOINT <mark>;

    <mark> :
      - a SQL identifier
      - a host variable (starting with :)

If you make *mark* all the same value when you specify multiple savepoints in a single transaction, only the latest savepoint appears in the partial rollback. The previous savepoints remain hidden until the rollback to the latest savepoint is performed and then appears when the latest savepoint disappears after being used. ::

    ROLLBACK [WORK] [TO [SAVEPOINT] <mark>];

    <mark>:
      - a SQL identifier
      - a host variable (starting with :)

Previously, the **ROLLBACK WORK** statement canceled all database changes added since the latest transaction. The **ROLLBACK WORK** statement is also used for the partial rollback that rolls back the transaction changes after the specified savepoint.

If *mark* value is not given, the transaction terminates canceling all changes including all savepoints created in the transaction. If *mark* value is given, changes after the specified savepoint are canceled and the ones before it are remained.

The below example shows how to rollback a part of a transaction.
Firstly, specify savepoints *SP1*, *SP2*.

.. code-block:: sql

    -- csql> ;autocommit off
    
    CREATE TABLE athlete2 (name VARCHAR(40), gender CHAR(1), nation_code CHAR(3), event VARCHAR(30));
    INSERT INTO athlete2(name, gender, nation_code, event)
    VALUES ('Lim Kye-Sook', 'W', 'KOR', 'Hockey');
    SAVEPOINT SP1;
     
    SELECT * from athlete2;
    INSERT INTO athlete2(name, gender, nation_code, event)
    VALUES ('Lim Jin-Suk', 'M', 'KOR', 'Handball');
     
    SELECT * FROM athlete2;
    SAVEPOINT SP2;
     
    RENAME TABLE athlete2 AS sportsman;
    SELECT * FROM sportsman;
    ROLLBACK WORK TO SP2;

In the example above, the name change of the *athlete2* table is rolled back by the partial rollback. The following example shows how to execute the query with the original name and examining the result.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM athlete2;
    DELETE FROM athlete2 WHERE name = 'Lim Jin-Suk';
    SELECT * FROM athlete2;
    ROLLBACK WORK TO SP2;

In the example above, deleting 'Lim Jin-Suk' is discarded by rollback work to *SP2* command.
The following example shows how to roll back to *SP1*.

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM athlete2;
    ROLLBACK WORK TO SP1;
    SELECT * FROM athlete2;
    COMMIT WORK;

.. _cursor-holding:

Cursor Holdability
==================

Cursor holdability is when an application holds the record set of the **SELECT** query result to fetch the next record even after performing an explicit commit or an automatic commit. In each application, cursor holdability can be specified as Connection level or Statement level. If it is not specified, the cursor is held by default. Therefore, **HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT** is the default setting.

The following code shows how to set cursor holdability in JDBC:

.. code-block:: java

    // set cursor holdability at the connection level
    conn.setHoldability(ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT);
     
    // set cursor holdability at the statement level which can override the connection
    PreparedStatement pStmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql,
                                        ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE,
                                        ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE,
                                        ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT);

To set cursor holdability to close the cursor when a transaction is committed, set **ResultSet.CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT**, instead of **ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT**, in the above example.

The default setting for applications that were developed based on CCI is to hold the cursor. If the cursor is set to 'not to hold a cursor' at connection level and you want to hold the cursor, define the **CCI_PREPARE_HOLDABLE** flag while preparing a query. The default setting for CCI drivers (PHP, PDO, ODBC, OLE DB, ADO.NET, Perl, Python, Ruby) is to hold the cursor. To check whether a driver supports the cursor holdability setting, refer to the **PREPARE** function of the driver.

.. note::

    * Note that versions lower than CUBRID 9.0 do not support cursor holdability. The default setting of those versions is to close all cursors at commit.
    * CUBRID currently does not support ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT in java.sql.XAConnection interface.

**Cursor-related Operation at Transaction Commit**

When a transaction is committed, all statements and result sets that are closed are released even if you have set cursor holdability. After that, when the result sets are used for another transaction, some or all of the result sets should be closed as required.

When a transaction is rolled back, all result sets are closed. This means that all result sets held in the previous transaction are closed because you have set cursor holdability.

.. code-block:: java

    rs1 = stmt.executeQuery(sql1);
    conn.commit();
    rs2 = stmt.executeQuery(sql2);
    conn.rollback();  // result sets rs1 and rs2 are closed and it will not be available to use them.

**When the Result Sets are Closed**

The result sets that hold the cursor are closed in the following cases:

*   Driver closes the result set, i.e. rs.close()
*   Driver closes the statement, i.e. stmt.close()
*   Driver disconnects the connection.
*   Transaction aborts, for instance, application explicitly calls rollback(), auto rollback due to a query failure under auto-commit mode.

**Relationship with CAS**

When the connection between an application and the CAS is closed, all result sets are automatically closed even if you have set cursor holdability in the application. The setting value of
**KEEP_CONNECTION**, the broker parameter, affects cursor holdability of the result set.

*   KEEP_CONNECTION = ON: Cursor holdability is not affected.
*   KEEP_CONNECTION = AUTO: The CAS cannot be restarted while the result set with cursor holdability is open.

.. warning:: Usage of memory will increase in the status of result set opened. Thus, you should close the result set after completion.

.. note:: Note that CUBRID versions lower than 9.0 do not support cursor holdability and the cursor is automatically closed when a transaction is committed. Therefore, the recordset of the **SELECT** query result is not kept.

.. _database-concurrency:

Database Concurrency
====================

If there are multiple users with read and write authorization to a database, possibility exists that more than one user will access the database simultaneously. Controlling access and update in multi-user environment is essential to protect database integrity and ensure that users and transactions should have accurate and consistent data. Without appropriate control, data could be updated incorrectly in the wrong order.

The transaction must ensure database concurrency, and each transaction must guarantee appropriate results. When multiple transactions are being executed at once, an event in transaction *T1* should not affect an event in transaction *T2*. This means isolation. Transaction isolation level is the degree to which a transaction is separated from all other concurrent transactions. The higher isolation level means the lower interference from other transactions. The lower isolation level means the higher the concurrency. A database determines whether which lock is applied to tables and records based on these isolation levels. Therefore, can control the level of consistency and concurrency specific to a service by setting appropriate isolation level.

The read operations that allow interference between transactions with isolation levels are as follows:

*   **Dirty read** : A transaction *T2* can read *D'* before a transaction *T1* updates data *D* to *D'* and commits it.
*   **Non-repeatable read** : A transaction *T1* can read changed value, if a transaction *T2* updates or deletes data and commits while data is retrieved in the transaction *T1* multiple times.
*   **Phantom read** : A transaction *T1* can read *E*, if a transaction *T2* inserts new record *E* and commits while data is retrieved in the transaction *T1* multiple times.

Based on these interferences, the SQL standard defines four levels of transaction isolation:

*   **READ UNCOMMITTED** allows dirty read, unrepeatable read and phantom read.
*   **READ COMMITTED** does not allow dirty read but allows unrepeatable read and phantom read.
*   **REPEATABLE READ** does not allow dirty read and unrepeatable read but allows phantom read.
*   **SERIALIZABLE** does not allow interrupts between transactions when doing read operation.

**Isolation Levels Provided by CUBRID**

On the below table, the number wrapped with parenthesis right after the isolation level name is a number which can be used instead of the isolation level name when setting an isolation level.

You can set an isolation level by using the :ref:`set-transaction-isolation-level` statement or system parameters provided by CUBRID. For details, see :ref:`lock-parameters`.

(O: YES, X: NO)

+--------------------------------+--------+---------------+----------+------------------------+
| CUBRID Isolation Level         | DIRTY  | UNREPEATABLE  | PHANTOM  | Schema Changes of the  |
| (isolation_level)              | READ   | READ          | READ     | Table Being Retrieved  |
+================================+========+===============+==========+========================+
| :ref:`isolation-level-6` (6)   | X      | X             | X        | X                      |
+--------------------------------+--------+---------------+----------+------------------------+
| :ref:`isolation-level-5` (5)   | X      | X             | O        | X                      |

+--------------------------------+--------+---------------+----------+------------------------+

The default value of CUBRID isolation level is :ref:`isolation-level-4`.

.. _mvcc-snapshot:

Multiversion Concurrency Control
================================

CUBRID previous versions managed isolation levels using the well known two phase locking protocol. In this protocol, a transaction obtains a shared lock before it reads an object, and an exclusive lock before it updates the object so that conflicting operations are not executed simultaneously. If transaction *T1* requires a lock, the system checks if the requested lock conflicts with the existing one. If it does, transaction *T1* enters a standby state and delays the lock. If another transaction *T2* releases the lock, transaction *T1* resumes and obtains it. Once the lock is released, the transaction do not require any new locks.

CUBRID 10.0 replaced the two phase locking protocol with a Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) protocol. Unlike two phase locking, MVCC does not block readers to access objects being modified by concurrent transactions. MVCC duplicates rows, creating multiple versions on each update. Never blocking readers is important for workloads involving mostly value reads from the database, commonly used in read-world scenarios. Exclusive locks are still required before updating objects.

MVCC is also known for providing point in time consistent view of the database and for being particularly adept at implementing true **snapshot isolation** with less performance costs than other methods of concurrency.

Versioning, visibility and snapshot
-----------------------------------

MVCC maintains multiple versions for each database row. Each version is marked by its inserter and deleter with MVCCID's - unique identifiers for writer transactions. These markers are useful to identify the author of a change and to place the change on a timeline.

When a transaction *T1* inserts a new row, it creates its first version and sets its unique identifier *MVCCID1* as insert id. The MVCCID is stored as meta-data in record header:

+------------------+-------------+---------------+
| OTHER META-DATA  | MVCCID1     | RECORD DATA   |
+------------------+-------------+---------------+

Until *T1* commits, other transactions should not see this row. The MVCCID helps identifying the authors of database changes and place them on a time line, so others can know if the change is valid or not. In this case, anyone checking this row find the *MVCCID1*, find out that the owner is still active, hence the row must be (still) invisible.

After *T1* commits, a new transaction *T2* finds the row and decides to remove it. *T2* does not remove this version, allowing others to access it, instead it gets an exclusive lock, to prevent others from changing it, and marks the version as deleted. It adds another MVCCID so others can identify the deleter:

+------------------+-------------+---------------+---------------+
| OTHER META-DATA  | MVCCID1     | MVCCID2       | RECORD DATA   |
+------------------+-------------+---------------+---------------+

If *T2* decides instead to update one of the record values, it must update the row to a new version and store the old version in log. The new row consists of new data, transaction MVCCID as insert MVCCID and the address of log entry storing previous version. The row representations looks like this:

HEAP file contains a single row identified by an OID:

+------------------+-------------+--------------------+---------------+
| OTHER META-DATA  | MVCCID_INS1 | PREV_VERSION_LSA1  |  RECORD DATA  |
+------------------+-------------+--------------------+---------------+

LOG file has a chain of log entries, the undo part of each log entry contains the original heap record before modification:

+----------------------+------------------+-------------+--------------------+---------------+
| LOG ENTRY META-DATA  | OTHER META-DATA  | MVCCID_INS2 | PREV_VERSION_LSA2  |  RECORD DATA  |
+----------------------+------------------+-------------+--------------------+---------------+

+----------------------+------------------+-------------+--------------------+---------------+
| LOG ENTRY META-DATA  | OTHER META-DATA  | MVCCID_INS3 | NULL               |  RECORD DATA  |
+----------------------+------------------+-------------+--------------------+---------------+

Other transactions may need to walk the log chain of previous version LSA of multiple log record until one record satisfies the visibility condition, determined by the values of insert and delete MVCCID of each record.

    .. note::

        *   Previous version used the heap (another OID) to store the old and new version of the updated rows. In fact, old version was the the row which remained unchanged, which was appended with and OID link to the new version. Both new version and old version were located in the heap.

Currently, only *T2* can see the updated row, while other transactions will access the row version contained on the log page and accessible through the LSA obtained from heap row. The property of a version to be seen or not to be seen by running transactions is called **visibility**. The visibility property is relative to each transaction, some can consider it true, whereas others can consider it false.

A transaction *T3* that starts after *T2* executes row update, but before *T2* commits, will not be able to see its new version, not even after *T2* commits. The visibility of one version towards *T3* depends on the state of its inserter and deleter when *T3* started and preserves its status for the lifetime of *T3*.

As a matter of fact, the visibility of all versions in database towards on transaction does not depend on the changes that occur after transaction is started. Moreover, any new version added is also ignored. Consequently, the set of all visible versions in the database remains unchanged and form the snapshot of the transaction. Hence, **snapshot isolation** is provided by MVCC and it is a guarantee that all read queries made in a transaction see a consistent view of the database.

In CUBRID 10.0, **snapshot** is a filter of all invalid MVCCID's. An MVCCID is invalid if it is not committed before the snapshot is taken. To avoid updating the snapshot filter whenever a new transaction starts, the snapshot is defined using two border MVCCID's: the lowest active MVCCID and the highest committed MVCCID. Only a list of active MVCCID values between the border is saved. Any transaction starting after snapshot is guaranteed to have an MVCCID bigger than highest committed and is automatically considered invalid. Any MVCCID below lowest active must be committed and is automatically considered valid.

The snapshot filter algorithm that decides a version visibility queries the MVCCID markers used for insert and delete. The snapshot starts by checking the *last version* stored in heap and, based on result, it can either fetch version from heap, fetch older version from log or can ignore row:

+--------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Insert MVCCID      | Previous version LSA     | Delete MVCCID       | Snapshot test result                                   |
+====================+==========================+=====================+========================================================+
| Not visible        | NULL                     | None or not visible | | Version is too *new* and is not visible              |
|                    |                          |                     | | Row has no previous version, so it is ignored        |
|                    +--------------------------+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
|                    | LSA                      | None or not visible | | Version is too *new* and is not visible              |
|                    |                          |                     | | Row has previous version and snapshot must check it  |
+--------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| None or visible    | LSA or NULL              | None or not visible | | Version is visible and its data is fetched           |
|                    |                          |                     | | It does not matter if row has previous versions      |
|                    |                          +---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
|                    |                          | Visible             | | Version is too old, was deleted and is not visible   |
|                    |                          |                     | | It does not matter if row has previous versions      |
+--------------------+--------------------------+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

If version is too new, but it has a previous version stored in log, the same checks are repeated on previous version. The checks stop when no previous versions are found (the entire row chain is too new for this transaction), or when a visible version is found.

Let's see how snapshot works (**REPEATABLE READ** isolation will be used to keep same snapshot during entire transaction):

**Example 1: Inserting a new row**

VACUUM
------

Creating new versions for each update and keeping old versions on delete could lead to unlimited database size growth, definitely a major issue for a database. Therefore, a clean up system is necessary, to remove obsolete data and reclaim the occupied space for reuse.

Each row version goes through same stages:

  1. newly inserted, not committed, visible only to its inserter.
  2. committed, invisible to preceding transactions, visible to future transactions.
  3. deleted, not committed, visible to other transactions, invisible to the deleter.
  4. committed, still visible to preceding transactions, invisible to future transactions.
  5. invisible to all active transactions.
  6. removed from database.
  
The role of the clean up system is to get versions from stage 5 to 6. This system is called **VACUUM** in CUBRID.

**VACUUM** system was developed with the guidance of three principles:

*   **VACUUM** must be correct and complete. **VACUUM** should never remove data still visible to some and it should not miss any obsolete data.
*   **VACUUM** must be discreet. Since clean-up process changes database content, there may be some interference in the activity of live transactions, but it must be kept to the minimum possible.
*   **VACUUM** must be fast and efficient. If **VACUUM** is too slow and if it starts lagging, the database state can deteriorate, thus the overall performance can be affected.

With these principles in mind, **VACUUM** implementation uses existing recovery logging, because:

*   The address is kept among recovery data for both heap and index changes. This allows **VACUUM** go directly to target, rather than scanning the database.
*   Processing log data rarely interferes with the work of active workers.

Log recovery was adapted to **VACUUM** needs by adding MVCCID information to logged data. **VACUUM** can decide based on MVCCID if the log entry is ready to be processed. MVCCID's that are still visible to active transactions cannot be processed. In due time, each MVCCID becomes old enough and all changes using the MVCCID become invisible.

Each transaction keeps the oldest MVCCID it considers active. The oldest MVCCID considered active by all running transactions is determined by the smallest oldest MVCCID of all transactions. Anything below this value is invisible and **VACUUM** can clean.

VACUUM Parallel Execution
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

According to the third principle of **VACUUM** it must be fast and it should not fall behind active workers. It is obvious that one thread cannot handle all the **VACUUM** works if system workload is heavy, thus it had to be parallelized.

To achieve parallelization, the log data was split into fixed size blocks. Each block generates one vacuum job, when the time is right (the most recent MVCCID can be vacuumed, which means all logged operations in the block can be vacuumed). Vacuum jobs are picked up by multiple **VACUUM Workers** that clean the database based on relevant log entries found in the log block. The tracking of log blocks and generating vacuum jobs is done by the **VACUUM Master**.

VACUUM Data
+++++++++++

Aggregated data on log blocks is stored in vacuum data file. Since the vacuum job generated by an operations occurs later in time, the data must be saved until the job can be executed, and it must also be persistent even if the server crashes. No operation is allowed to leak and not be vacuumed. If the server crashes, some jobs may be executed twice, which is preferable to not being executed at all.

After a job has been successfully executed, the aggregated data on the processed log block is removed.

Aggregated log block data is not added directly to vacuum data. A latch-free buffer is used to avoid synchronizing active working threads (which generate the log blocks and their aggregated data) with the vacuum system. **VACUUM Master** wakes up periodically, dumps everything in buffer to vacuum data, removes data already process and generates new jobs (if available).

VACUUM jobs
+++++++++++

Vacuum job execution steps:

  1. **Log pre-fetch**. Vacuum master or workers pre-fetch log pages to be processed by the job.
  2. **Repeat for each log record**:
  
    1. **Read** log record.
    2. **Check dropped file.** If the log record points to dropped file, proceed to next log record.
    3. **Execute index vacuum and collect heap OID's**
    
      * If log record belongs to index, execute vacuum immediately.
      * If log record belongs to heap, collect OID to be vacuumed later.
    
  3. **Execute heap vacuum** based on collected OID's.
  4. **Complete job.** Mark the job as completed in vacuum data.
  
Several measures were taken to ease log page reading and to optimize vacuum execution.

Tracking dropped files
++++++++++++++++++++++

When a transaction drops a table or an index, it usually locks the affected table(s) and prevents others from accessing it. Opposed to active workers, **VACUUM** Workers are not allowed to use locking system, for two reasons: interference with active workers must be kept to the minimum, and **VACUUM** system is never supposed to stop as long as it has data to clean. Moreover, **VACUUM** is not allowed to skip any data that needs cleaning. This has two consequences:

  1. **VACUUM** doesn't stop from cleaning a file belonging to a dropped table or a dropped index until the dropper commits. Even if a transaction drops a table, its file is not immediately destroyed and it can still be accessed. The actual destruction is postponed until after commit.
  2. Before the actual file destruction, **VACUUM** system must be notified. The dropper sends a notification to **VACUUM** system and then waits for the confirmation. **VACUUM** works on very short iterations and it checks for new dropped files frequently, so the dropper doesn't have to wait for a long time.
  
After a file is dropped, **VACUUM** will ignore all found log entries that belong to the file. The file identifier, paired with an MVCCID that marks the moment of drop, is stored in a persistent file until **VACUUM** decides it is safe to remove it (the decision is based on the smallest MVCCID not yet vacuumed).

.. _lock-protocol:

Lock Protocol
=============

In the two-phase locking protocol, a transaction obtains a shared lock before it reads an object, and an exclusive lock before it updates the object so that conflicting operations are not executed simultaneously. The MVCC locking protocol, which is now used by CUBRID, does not require shared locks before reading rows (however intent shared lock on table object is still used to read its rows). If transaction *T1* requires a lock, CUBRID checks if the requested lock conflicts with the existing one. If it does, transaction *T1* enters a standby state and delays the lock. If another transaction *T2* releases the lock, transaction *T1* resumes and obtains it. Once the lock is released, the transaction do not acquire any new locks.

Granularity Locking
-------------------

CUBRID uses a granularity locking protocol to decrease the number of locks. In the granularity locking protocol, a database can be modelled as a hierarchy of lockable units: row lock, table lock and database lock. Coarser locks have more granular locks.

If the locking granularities overlap, effects of a finer granularity are propagated in order to prevent conflicts. That is, if a shared lock is required on an instance of a table, an intent shared lock will be set on the table. If an exclusive lock is required on an instance of a table, an intent exclusive lock will be set on the table. An intent shared lock on a table means that a shared lock can be set on an instance of the table. An intent exclusive lock on a table means that a shared/exclusive lock can be set on an instance of the table. That is, if an intent shared lock on a table is allowed in one transaction, another transaction cannot obtain an exclusive lock on the table (for example, to add a new column). However, the second transaction may obtain a shared lock on the table. If an intent exclusive lock on the table is allowed in one transaction, another transaction cannot obtain a shared lock on the table (for example, a query on an instance of the tables cannot be executed because it is being changed).

A mechanism called lock escalation is used to limit the number of locks being managed. If a transaction has more than a certain number of locks (a number which can be changed by the **lock_escalation** system parameter), the system begins to require locks at the next higher level of granularity. This escalates the locks to a coarser level of granularity. CUBRID performs lock escalation when no transactions have a higher level of granularity in order to avoid a deadlock caused by lock conversion.

.. _lock-mode:

Lock Mode Types And Compatibility
---------------------------------

CUBRID determines the lock mode depending on the type of operation to be performed by the transaction, and determines whether or not to share the lock depending on the mode of the lock preoccupied by another transaction. Such decisions concerning the lock are made by the system automatically. Manual assignment by the user is not allowed. To check the lock information of CUBRID, use the **cubrid lockdb** *db_name* command. For details, see :ref:`lockdb`.

*   **Shared lock (shared lock, S_LOCK, no longer used with MVCC protocol)**

    This lock is obtained before the read operation is executed on the object. 
    
    It can be obtained by multiple transactions for the same object. At this time, transaction *T2* and *T3* can perform the read operation on the object concurrently, but not the update operation.

    .. note::

        *   Shared locks are rarely used in CUBRID 10.0, because of MVCC. It is still used, mostly in internal database operations, to protect rows or index keys from being modified.

*   **Exclusive lock (exclusive lock, X_LOCK)**

    This lock is obtained before the update operation is executed on the object. 

    It can only be obtained by one transaction. Transaction *T1* obtains the exclusive lock first before it performs the update operation on a certain object *X*, and does not release it until transaction *T1* is committed even after the update operation is completed. Therefore, transaction *T2* and *T3* cannot perform the read operation as well on *X* before transaction *T1* releases the exclusive lock.

*   **Intent lock**

    This lock is set inherently in a higher-level object than a certain object to protect the lock on the object of a certain level.
    
    For example, when a shared lock is requested for a certain row, prevent a situation from occurring in which the table is locked by another transaction by setting the intent shared lock as well on the table at the higher level in hierarchy. Therefore, the intent lock is not set on rows at the lowest level, but is set on higher-level objects. The types of intent locks are as follows:

    *   **Intent shared lock (IS_LOCK)**
    
        If the intent shared lock is set on the table, which is the higher-level object, as a result of the shared lock set on a certain row, another transaction cannot perform operations such as changing the schema of the table (e.g. adding a column or changing the table name) or updating all rows. However updating some rows or viewing all rows is allowed.

    *   **Intent exclusive lock (IX_LOCK)**

        If the intent exclusive lock is set on the table, which is the higher-level object, as a result of the exclusive lock set on a certain row, another transaction cannot perform operations such as changing the schema of the table, updating or viewing all rows. However updating some rows is allowed.

    *   **Shared with intent exclusive lock(SIX_LOCK)**

        This lock is set on the higher-level object inherently to protect the shared lock set on all objects at the lower hierarchical level and the intent exclusive lock on some object at the lower hierarchical level.

        Once the shared intent exclusive lock is set on a table, another transaction cannot change the schema of the table, update all/some rows or view all rows. However, viewing some rows is allowed.
    
*   **Schema Lock**

    A schema lock is acquired when executing DDL work.

    *   **Schema stability lock, SCH_S_LOCK**

        This lock is acquired during compiling a query and it guarantees that the schema which is included in this query is not changed.

    *   **Schema modification lock, SCH_M_LOCK**

        This lock is acquired during running DDL(**ALTER**/**CREATE**/**DROP**) and it protects that other transactions access the modified schema.

    Some DDL operations like **ALTER**, **CREATE INDEX** do not acquire **SCH_M_LOCK** directly. For example, CUBRID operates type checking about filtering expression when you create a filtered index; during this term, the lock which is kept to the target table is **SCH_S_LOCK** like other type checking operations. The lock is then upgraded to **SIX_LOCK** (other transactions are prevented from modifying target table rows, but they can continue reading them), and finally **SCH_M_LOCK** is requested to change the table schema. The method has a strength to increase the concurrency by allowing other transaction's operation during DDL operation's compilation and execution.
    
    However, it also has a weakness not to avoid a deadlock when DDL operations are operated at the same table at the same time. A deadlock case by loading indexes is as follows.

*   **Special Locks**

    **CUBRID 10.2** introduces a new type of locks, which are used in a few special cases of internal operations.

    *   **Bulk Update Lock, BU_LOCK**

        This lock is designed for inserting large amounts of data into the database. As of **CUBRID 10.2**, this lock is exclusively used during the :ref:`loaddb` process while loading rows into a table. **BU_LOCK** is compatible with itself and **SCH_S_LOCK**; as a result this ensures that no other **SELECT/DML/DDL** statements are allowed on the same table. However, multiple **loaddb** may load rows into a table. The **BU_LOCK** holder doesn't require row locks.

.. note:: This is a summarized description about locking.

    *   There are row(instance) and schema(class) about objects of locking targets. The locks grouped by the type of objects they're used:

        *   row locks: **S_LOCK**, **X_LOCK**
        
        *   intention/schema locks: **IX_LOCK**, **IS_LOCK**, **SIX_LOCK**, **SCH_S_LOCK**, **SCH_M_LOCK**
        
        *   special locks: **BU_LOCK**
        
    *   All types of locks affect each other.
    
The following table briefly shows the lock compatibility between the locks described above. Compatibility means that the lock requester can obtain a lock while the lock holder is keeping the lock obtained for a certain object.

Examples using locks
++++++++++++++++++++

For next few examples, REPEATABLE READ(5) isolation level will be used. READ COMMITTED has different rules for updating rows and will be presented in next section (reference here).
The examples will make use of lockdb utility to show existing locks.

**Locking example:**
For next example REPEATABLE READ(5) isolation will be used and it will prove that read and write on same row are not blocked. Also conflicting updates will be tried, where the second updater is blocked. When transaction T1 commits, T2 is unblocked but update is not permitted because of isolation level restrictions. If T1 would rollback, then T2 can proceed with its update.

Locking to protect unique constraint
------------------------------------

Two phase locking protocol in older CUBRID versions used index key locks to protect unique constraints and higher isolation restrictions. In CUBRID 10.0, key locking was removed. Isolation level restrictions are solved by MVCC snapshot, however unique constraint still needed some type of protection.

With MVCC, unique index can keep multiple versions at the same time, similarly to rows, each visible to different transactions. One is the last version, while the other versions are kept temporarily until they become invisible and can be removed by **VACUUM**. The rule to protect unique constraint is that all transactions trying to modify a key has to lock key's last existing version.

The below example uses **REPEATABLE READ** isolation to show the way locking prevents unique constraint violations.

Transaction Deadlock
--------------------

A deadlock is a state in which two or more transactions wait at once for another transaction's lock to be released. CUBRID resolves the problem by rolling back one of the transactions because transactions in a deadlock state will hinder the work of another transaction. The transaction to be rolled back is usually the transaction which has made the least updates; it is usually the one that started more recently. As soon as a transaction is rolled back, the lock held by the transaction is released and other transactions in a deadlock are permitted to proceed.

It is impossible to predict such deadlocks, but it is recommended that you reduce the range to which lock is applied by setting the index, shortening the transaction, or setting the transaction isolation level as low in order to decrease such occurrences.

Note that if you configure the value of **error_log_level**, which indicates the severity level, to NOTIFICATION, information on lock is stored in error log file of server upon deadlock occurrences.

Compared to older versions, CUBRID 10.0 no longer uses index key locking to read and write in index, thus deadlock occurrences have been greatly reduced. Another reason that deadlocks do not occur as often is that reading a range in index could lock many objects with high isolation levels in previous CUBRID versions, whereas CUBRID 10.0 uses no locks.

However, deadlocks are still possible when two transaction update same objects, but in a different order.

Transaction Lock Timeout
------------------------

CUBRID provides the lock timeout feature, which sets the waiting time for the lock until the transaction lock setting is allowed.

If the lock is allowed within the lock timeout, CUBRID rolls back the transaction and outputs an error message when the timeout has passed. If a transaction deadlock occurs within the lock timeout, CUBRID rolls back the transaction whose waiting time is closest to the timeout.

**Setting the Lock Timeout**

The system parameter **lock_timeout** in the **$CUBRID/conf/cubrid.conf** file or the **SET TRANSACTION** statement sets the timeout (in seconds) during which the application will wait for the lock and rolls back the transaction and outputs an error message when the specified time has passed. The default value of the **lock_timeout** parameter is **-1**, which means the application will wait indefinitely until the transaction lock is allowed. Therefore, the user can change this value depending on the transaction pattern of the application. If the lock timeout value has been set to 0, an error message will be displayed as soon as a lock occurs. ::

    SET TRANSACTION LOCK TIMEOUT timeout_spec [ ; ]
    timeout_spec:
    - INFINITE
    - OFF
    - unsigned_integer
    - variable

*   **INFINITE** : Wait indefinitely until the transaction lock is allowed. Has the same effect as setting the system parameter **lock_timeout** to -1.
*   **OFF** : Do not wait for the lock, but roll back the transaction and display an error message. Has the same effect as setting the system parameter **lock_timeout** to 0.
*   *unsigned_integer* : Set in seconds. Wait for the transaction lock for the specified time period.
*   *variable* : A variable can be specified. Wait for the transaction lock for the value stored by the variable.

**Example 1** ::

    vi $CUBRID/conf/cubrid.conf
    ...
    lock_timeout = 10s
    ...

**Example 2** ::

    SET TRANSACTION LOCK TIMEOUT 10;

**Checking the Lock Timeout**

You can check the lock timeout set for the current application by using the **GET TRANSACTION** statement, or store this value in a variable. ::

    GET TRANSACTION LOCK TIMEOUT [ { INTO | TO } variable ] [ ; ]

**Example** ::

    GET TRANSACTION LOCK TIMEOUT;
    
             Result
    ===============
      1.000000e+001

**Checking and Handling Lock Timeout Error Message**

The following message is displayed if lock timeout occurs in a transaction that has been waiting for another transaction's lock to be released. ::

    Your transaction (index 2, user1@host1|9808) timed out waiting on IX_LOCK lock on class tbl. You are waiting for
    user(s) user1@host1|csql(9807), user1@host1|csql(9805) to finish.

*   Your transaction(index 2 ...): This means that the index of the transaction that was rolled back due to timeout while waiting for the lock is 2. The transaction index is a number that is sequentially assigned when the client connects to the database server. You can also check this number by executing the **cubrid lockdb** utility.

*   (... user1\@host1|9808): *cub_user* is the login ID of the client and the part after @ is the name of the host where the client was running. The part after| is the process ID (PID) of the client.

*   IX_LOCK: This means the exclusive lock set on the object to perform data update. For details, see :ref:`lock-mode`.

*   user1@host1|csql(9807), user1@host1|csql(9805): Another transactions waiting for termination to lock **IX_LOCK**

That is, the above lock error message can be interpreted as meaning that "Because another client is holding **X_LOCK** on a specific row in the *participant* table, transaction 3 which running on the host *host1* waited for the lock and the timeout has passed". If you want to check the lock information of the transaction specified in the error message, you can do so by using the **cubrid lockdb** utility to search for the OID value (ex: 0|636|34) of a specific row where the **X_LOCK** is set currently to find the transaction ID currently holding the lock, the client program name and the process ID (PID). For details, see :ref:`lockdb`. You can also check the transaction lock information in the CUBRID Manager.

You can organize the transactions by checking uncommitted queries through the SQL log after checking the transaction lock information in the manner described above. For information on checking the SQL log, see :ref:`broker-logs`.

Also, you can forcefully stop problematic transactions by using the **cubrid killtran** utility. For details, see :ref:`killtran`.

.. _transaction-isolation-level:

Transaction Isolation Level
===========================

The transaction isolation level is determined based on how much interference occurs. The higher isolation means the less interference from other transactions and more serializable. The lower isolation means the more interference from other transactions and higher level of concurrency. You can control the level of consistency and concurrency specific to a service by setting appropriate isolation level.

.. note:: A transaction can be restored in all supported isolation levels because updates are not committed before the end of the transaction.

.. _set-transaction-isolation-level:

SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL
-------------------------------

You can set the level of transaction isolation by using **isolation_level** and the **SET TRANSACTION** statement in the **$CUBRID/conf/cubrid.conf**. The level of **READ COMMITTED** is set by default, which indicates the level 4 through level 4 to 6 (levels 1 to 3 were used by older versions of CUBRID and are now obsolete). For details, see :ref:`database-concurrency`. ::

    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL isolation_level_spec ;
    
    isolation_level_spec:
        SERIALIZABLE | 6
        REPETABLE READ | 5
        READ COMMITTED | CURSOR STABILITY | 4

**Example 1** ::

    vi $CUBRID/conf/cubrid.conf
    ...

    isolation_level = 4
    ...
     
    -- or
     
    isolation_level = "TRAN_READ_COMMITTED"

**Example 2** ::

    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL 4;
    -- or
    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

If the transaction level is changed in an application while a transaction is executed, the new level is applied to the rest of the transaction being executed. It is recommended that to modify the transaction isolation level when a transaction starts (after commit, rollback or system restart) because an isolation level which has already been set does not apply to the entire transaction, but can be changed during the transaction.

GET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL
-------------------------------

You can assign the current isolation level to *variable* by using the **GET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL** statement. The following is a statement that verifies the isolation level. ::

    GET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL [ { INTO | TO } variable ] [ ; ]

.. code-block:: sql

    GET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL;
    
::

           Result
    =============
      READ COMMITTED
      
.. _isolation-level-4:

READ COMMITTED Isolation Level
------------------------------

A relatively low isolation level (4). A dirty read does not occur, but non-repeatable or phantom read may. That is, transaction *T1* can read another value because insert or update by transaction *T2* is allowed while transaction *T1* is repeatedly retrieving one object.

The following are the rules of this isolation level:

*   Transaction *T1* cannot read or modify the record inserted by another transaction *T2*. The record is instead ignored.
*   Transaction *T1* can read the record being updated by another transaction *T2* and it sees the record's last committed version (but it cannot see uncommitted versions).
*   Transaction *T1* cannot modify the record being updated by another transaction *T2*. *T1* waits for *T2* to commit and it re-evaluates record values. If the re-evaluation test is passed, *T1* modifies the record, otherwise it ignores it.
*   Transaction *T1* can modify the record being viewed by another transaction *T2*.
*   Transaction *T1* can update/insert record to the table being viewed by another transaction *T2*.
*   Transaction *T1* cannot change the schema of the table being viewed by another transaction *T2*.
*   Transaction *T1* creates a new snapshot with each executed statement, thus phantom or non-repeatable read may occur.

This isolation level follows MVCC locking protocol for an exclusive lock. A shared lock on a row is not required; however, an intent lock on a table is released when a transaction terminates to ensure repeatable read on the schema.

**Example**

The following example shows that a phantom or non-repeatable read may occur because another transaction can add or update a record while one transaction is performing the object read but repeatable read for the table schema update is ensured when the transaction level of the concurrent transactions is **READ COMMITTED**.

READ COMMITTED UPDATE RE-EVALUATION
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**READ COMMITTED** isolation treats concurrent row updates differently than higher isolation levels. In higher isolation levels, if *T2* tries to modify a row already updated by concurrent transaction *T1*, it is blocked until *T1* commits and rollbacks, and if *T1* commits, *T2* aborts its statement execution, throwing serialization error. Under **READ COMMITTED** isolation, after *T1* commits, *T2* does not immediately abort its statement execution and re-evaluates the new version, which is not considered committed and would not violate any restrictions for this isolation. If the predicate used to select previous version is still true for the new version, *T2* goes ahead and modifies the new version. If the predicate is no longer true, *T2* just ignores the record as if the predicate was never satisfied.

*Example:*

REPEATABLE READ Isolation Level
-------------------------------

A relatively high isolation level (5). Dirty, non-repeatable, and phantom reads do not occur due to **snapshot isolation**. However, it's still not truly **serializable**, transaction execution cannot be defined *as if there were no other transactions running* at the same time. More complex anomalies, like write skews, that a **serializable snapshot isolation** level should not allow still occur.

In a write skew anomaly, two transactions concurrently read overlapping data sets and make disjoint updates on the overlapped data set, neither having seen the update performed by the other. In a serializable system, such anomaly would be impossible, since one transaction must occur first and the second transaction should see the update of the first transaction.

The following are the rules of this isolation level:

*   Transaction *T1* cannot read or modify the record inserted by another transaction *T2*. The record is instead ignored.
*   Transaction *T1* can read the record being updated by another transaction *T2* and it will see the record's last committed version.
*   Transaction *T1* cannot modify the record being updated by another transaction *T2*.
*   Transaction *T1* can modify the record being viewed by another transaction *T2*.
*   Transaction *T1* can update/insert record to the table being viewed by another transaction *T2*.
*   Transaction *T1* cannot change the schema of the table being viewed by another transaction *T2*.
*   Transaction *T1* creates a unique snapshot valid throughout the entire duration of the transaction.

**Example**

The following example shows that non-repeatable and phantom reads may not occur because of **snapshot isolation**. However, write skews are possible, which means the isolation level is not **serializable**.

.. _isolation-level-6:

SERIALIZABLE Isolation Level
----------------------------

CUBRID 10.0 **SERIALIZABLE** isolation level is identical to **REPEATABLE READ** isolation level. As explained in :ref:`isolation-level-5` section, even though **SNAPSHOT** isolation ensures non-repeatable read and phantom read anomalies do not happen, write skew anomalies are still possible. To protect against write skew, index key locks for read may be used. Alternatively, there are many works that describe complex systems to provide **SERIALIZABLE SNAPSHOT ISOLATION**, by aborting transactions with the potential of creating an isolation conflict. One such system will be provided in a future CUBRID version.

The keyword was not removed for backward compatibility reasons, but remember, it is similar to **REPEATABLE READ**.

.. _dirty-record-flush:

How to Handle Dirty Record
--------------------------

CUBRID flushes dirty data (or dirty record) in the client buffers to the database (server) such as the following situations. In additions to those, there can be more situations where flushes can be performed.

*   Dirty data can be flushed to server when a transaction is committed.
*   Some of dirty data can be flushed to server when a lot of data is loaded into the client buffers.
*   Dirty data of table *A* can be flushed to server when the schema of table *A* is updated.
*   Dirty data of table *A* can be flushed to server when the table *A* is retrieved (**SELECT**)
*   Some of dirty data can be flushed to server when a server function is called.

Transaction Termination and Restoration
=======================================

The restore process in CUBRID makes it possible that the database is not affected even if a software or hardware error occurs. In CUBRID, all read and update commands that are made during a transaction must be atomic. This means that either all of the transaction's commands are committed to the database or none are. The concept of atomicity is extended to the set of operations that consists of a transaction. The transaction must either commit so that all effects are permanently applied to the database or roll back so that all effects are removed. To ensure transaction atomicity, CUBRID applies the effects of the committed transaction again every time an error occurs without the updates of the transaction being written to the disk. CUBRID also removes the effects of partially committed transactions in the database every time the site fails (some transactions may have not committed or applications may have requested to cancel transactions). This restore feature eases the burden for the applications of maintaining the database consistency depending on the system error. The restore process used in CUBRID is based on the undo/redo logging mechanism.

CUBRID provides an automatic restore method to maintain the transaction atomicity when a hardware or software error occurs. You do not have to take the responsibility for restore since CUBRID's restore feature always returns the database to a consistent state even when an application or computer system error occurs. For this purpose, CUBRID automatically rolls back part of committed transactions when the application fails or the user requests explicitly. For example, a system error that occurred during the execution of the **COMMIT WORK** statement must be stopped if the transaction has not committed yet (it cannot be confirmed that the user's operation has been committed). Automatic stop prevents errors causing undesired changes to the database by canceling uncommitted updates.

Restarting Database
-------------------

CUBRID uses log volumes/files and database backups to restore committed or uncommitted transactions when system or media (disk) error occurs. Logs are also used to support the user-specified rollback. A log consists of a collection of sequential files created by CUBRID. The most recent log is called the active log, and the rest are called archive logs. A log file refers to both the active and archive logs.

All updates of the database are written to the log. Actually, two copies of the updates are logged. The first one is called a before image (UNDO log) and used to restore data during execution of the user-specified **ROLLBACK WORK** statement or during media or system errors. The second copy is an after image (REDO log) and used to re-apply the updates when media or system error occurs.

When the active log is full, CUBRID copies it to an archive log to store in the disk. The archive log is needed to restore the database when a system failure occurs.

**Normal Termination or Error**

CUBRID restores the database if it restarts due to a normal termination or a device error. The restore process re-applies the committed changes that have not been applied to the database and removes the uncommitted changes stored in the database. The general operation of the database resumes after the restore is completed. This restore process does not use any archive logs or database backup.

In a client/server environment, the database can restart by using the **cubrid server** utility.

**Media Error**

The user's intervention is somewhat needed to restart the database after media error occurs. The first step is to restore the database by installing a backup of a known good state. In CUBRID, the most recent log file (the one after the last backup) must be installed. This specific log (archive or active) is applied to a backup copy of the database. As with normal termination, the database can restart after restoration is committed.

.. note::

    To minimize the possibility of losing database updates, it is recommended to create a snapshot and store it in the backup media before it is deleted from the disk. The DBA can backup and restore the database by using the **cubrid backupdb** and **cubrid restoredb** utilities. For details on these utilities, see :ref:`backupdb`.
